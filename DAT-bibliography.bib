Using a definable version of the Universal Coefficient Theorem, we prove that the corresponding definable \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{K\}\$-homology is a finer invariant than the purely algebraic one, even when restricted to the class of {UHF} C*-algebras, or to the class of unital commutative C*-algebras whose spectrum is a \$1\$-dimensional connected subspace of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$.},

We then define quantum and non-signalling isomorphisms by considering perfect quantum and non-signalling strategies for this game. We prove that non-signalling isomorphism coincides with fractional isomorphism, giving the latter an operational interpretation. We show that quantum isomorphism is equivalent to the feasibility of two polynomial systems obtained by relaxing standard integer programs for graph isomorphism to Hermitian variables. Finally, we provide a reduction from linear binary constraint system games to isomorphism games. This reduction provides examples of quantum isomorphic graphs that are not isomorphic, implies that the tensor product and commuting operator frameworks result in different notions of quantum isomorphism, and proves that both relations are undecidable.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we accomplish two objectives. Firstly, we extend and improve some results in the theory of (semi-)strongly self-absorbing C⁎-dynamical systems, which was introduced and studied in previous work. In particular, this concerns the theory when restricted to the case where all the semi-strongly self-absorbing actions are assumed to be unitarily regular, which is a mild technical condition. The central result in the first part is a strengthened version of the equivariant {McDuff}-type theorem, where equivariant tensorial absorption can be achieved with respect to so-called very strong cocycle conjugacy. Secondly, we establish completely new results within the theory. This mainly concerns how equivariantly Z-stable absorption can be reduced to equivariantly {UHF}-stable absorption with respect to a given semi-strongly self-absorbing action. Combining these abstract results with known uniqueness theorems due to Matui and Izumi–Matui, we obtain the following main result. If G is a torsion-free abelian group and D is one of the known strongly self-absorbing C⁎-algebras, then strongly outer G-actions on D are unique up to (very strong) cocycle conjugacy. This is new even for Z3-actions on the Jiang–Su algebra.},

	abstract = {The Connes Embedding Problem ({CEP}) is a problem in the theory of tracial von Neumann algebras and asks whether or not every tracial von Neumann algebra embeds into an ultrapower of the hyperfinite {II}\$\_1\$ factor. The {CEP} has had interactions with a wide variety of areas of mathematics, including C*-algebra theory, geometric group theory, free probability, and noncommutative real algebraic geometry (to name a few). After remaining open for over 40 years, a negative solution was recently obtained as a corollary of a landmark result in quantum complexity theory known as \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{{MIP}\}{\textasciicircum}*={\textbackslash}operatorname\{{RE}\}\$. In these notes, we introduce all of the background material necessary to understand the proof of the negative solution of the {CEP} from \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{{MIP}\}{\textasciicircum}*={\textbackslash}operatorname\{{RE}\}\$. In fact, we outline two such proofs, one following the "traditional" route that goes via Kirchberg's {QWEP} problem in C*-algebra theory and Tsirelson's problem in quantum information theory and a second that uses basic ideas from logic.},

As a key tool, we prove versions of Carathéodory’s and of Minkowski’s theorems for matrix convex sets.},

	abstract = {This dissertation is dedicated to the study of operator spaces, operator algebras, and their automorphisms using methods from logic, particularly descriptive set theory and model theory. The material is divided into three main themes. The first one concerns the notion of Polish groupoids and functorial complexity. Such a study is motivated by the fact that the categories of Elliott-classifiable algebras, Elliott invariants, abelian separable C*-algebras, and arbitrary separable C*-algebras have the same complexity according to the usual notion of Borel complexity. The goal is to provide a functorial refinement of Borel complexity, able to capture the complexity of classifying the objects in a functorial way. Our main result is that functorial Borel complexity provides a finer distinction of the complexity of functorial classification problems. 
 
The second main theme concerns the classification problem for automorphisms of C*-algebras from the perspective of Borel complexity theory. Our results show that, for any non-elementary simple separable C*-algebra, the problem of classifying its automorphisms up to unitary equivalence transcends countable structures. Furthermore we prove that in the unital case the relation of unitary equivalence obeys the following dichotomy: it is either smooth, when the algebra has continuous trace, or not classifiable by countable structures. 
 
The last theme concerns applications of model theory to the study and construction of interesting operator spaces and operator systems. Specifically we show that the Gurarij operator space introduced by Oikhberg can be characterized as the Fraisse limit of the class of finite-dimensional 1-exact operator spaces. This proves that the Gurarij operator space is unique, homogeneous, and universal among separable 1-exact operator spaces. Moreover we prove that, while being 1-exact, the Gurarij operator space does not embed into any exact C*-algebra. Furthermore the ternary ring of operators generated by the Gurarij operator space is canonical, and does not depend on the concrete representation chosen. We also construct the operator system analog of the Gurarij operator space, and prove that it has analogous properties.},

Definable subcategories are precisely the finite-injectivity classes. We prove a 2-duality between the 2-category of small exact categories and the 2-category of definable categories, and provide a new proof of its additive version. We further introduce a third vertex of the 2-category of regular toposes and show that the diagram of 2-(anti-)equivalences between three 2-categories commutes; the corresponding additive triangle is well-known.},

Given topological abelian groups G and H, we say that Ext(G,H) is trivial if every extension of topological abelian groups of the form 1→H→X→G→1 splits. We prove that Ext(A(Y),K) is trivial for any free abelian topological group A(Y) over a zero-dimensional kω-space Y and every compact abelian group K. Moreover we show that if K is a compact subgroup of a topological abelian group X such that the quotient group X/K is a zero-dimensional kω-space, then there exists a continuous cross section from X/K to X. In the second part of the article we prove that Ext(G,H) is trivial whenever G is a product of locally precompact abelian groups and H has the form Tα×Rβ for arbitrary cardinal numbers α and β. An analogous result is true if G=∏i∈{IGi} where each Gi is a dense subgroup of a maximally almost periodic, Čech-complete group for which both Ext(Gi,R) and Ext(Gi,T) are trivial.},

	abstract = {In this paper we explore the extent to which the algebraic structure of a monoid \$M\$ determines the topologies on \$M\$ that are compatible with its multiplication. Specifically we study the notions of automatic continuity; minimal Hausdorff or Polish semigroup topologies; and we formulate a notion of the Zariski topology for monoids. If \$M\$ is a topological monoid such that every homomorphism from \$M\$ to a second countable topological monoid \$N\$ is continuous, then we say that \$M\$ has {\textbackslash}emph\{automatic continuity\}. We show that many well-known monoids have automatic continuity with respect to a natural semigroup topology, namely: the full transformation monoid \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$; the full binary relation monoid \$B\_\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\}\$; the partial transformation monoid \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\}\$; the symmetric inverse monoid \$I\_\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\}\$; the monoid Inj\$({\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\})\$ consisting of the injective functions on \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$; and the monoid \$C(2{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\})\$ of continuous functions on the Cantor set. We show that the pointwise topology on \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$, and its analogue on \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\}\$, are the unique Polish semigroup topologies on these monoids. The compact-open topology is the unique Polish semigroup topology on \$C(2{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\})\$ and \$C([0, 1]{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\})\$. There are at least 3 Polish semigroup topologies on \$I\_\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\}\$, but a unique Polish inverse semigroup topology. There are no Polish semigroup topologies \$B\_\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\}\$ nor on the partitions monoids. At the other extreme, Inj\$({\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\})\$ and the monoid Surj\$({\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\})\$ of all surjective functions on \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$ each have infinitely many distinct Polish semigroup topologies. We prove that the Zariski topologies on \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$, \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\}\$, and Inj\$({\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\})\$ coincide with the pointwise topology; and we characterise the Zariski topology on \$B\_\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\}\$.

	abstract = {Consider an exact category in the sense of Quillen. Assume that in this category every morphism has a kernel and that every kernel is an inflation. In their seminal 1982 paper, Beĭlinson, Bernstein and Deligne consider in this setting a t-structure on the derived category and remark that its heart can be described as a category of formal quotients. They further point out that the category of Banach spaces is an example, and that here a similar category of formal quotients was studied by Waelbroeck already in 1962. In the current article, we give a direct and rigorous construction of the latter category by considering first the monomorphism category. Then we localize with respect to a multiplicative system. Our approach gives rise to a heart-like category not only for the Banach spaces. In particular, the main results apply to categories in which the set of all kernel–cokernel pairs does not form an exact structure. Such categories arise frequently in functional analysis.},

They are close to triangulated categories, with the main difference that triangles are replaced by 4-termed complexes (=triads) which are functorial. In addition, the triadic category M(Λ-{CM}) is exact, i.e. it has a distinguished class of short exact sequences with the usual properties. We give a new characterization of triadic categories which makes no use of localization. As a consequence, the triadic structure of M(Λ-{CM}) can be derived from the exact structure of M(M(Λ-{CM})).},

As applications, Sn(X) is a resolving contravariantly finite subcategory in Tn(A)-mod with Sn(X)ˆ=Tn(A)-mod if and only if X is a resolving contravariantly finite subcategory in A-mod with Xˆ=A-mod. For a Gorenstein algebra A, the category Tn(A)-Gproj of Gorenstein-projective Tn(A)-modules can be explicitly determined as Sn(A⊥). Also, self-injective algebras A can be characterized by the property Tn(A)-Gproj=Sn(A). Finally, we obtain a characterization of those categories Sn(A) which have finite representation type in terms of Auslanderʼs representation dimension.},

@article{henrard_left_2021,
	title = {The left heart and exact hull of an additive regular category},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11483},
	abstract = {Quasi-abelian categories are abundant in functional analysis and representation theory. It is known that a quasi-abelian category \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$ is a cotilting torsionfree class of an abelian category. In fact, this property characterizes quasi-abelian categories. This ambient abelian category is derived equivalent to the category \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$, and can be constructed as the heart \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{{LH}\}({\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\})\$ of a \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{t\}\$-structure on the bounded derived category \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{D{\textasciicircum}b\}({\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\})\$ or as the localization of the category of monomorphisms in \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}.\$ However, there are natural examples of categories in functional analysis which are not quasi-abelian, but merely one-sided quasi-abelian or even weaker. Examples are the category of \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{{LB}\}\$-spaces or the category of complete Hausdorff locally convex spaces. In this paper, we consider additive regular categories as a generalization of quasi-abelian categories that covers the aforementioned examples. These categories can be characterized as pre-torsionfree subcategories of abelian categories. As for quasi-abelian categories, we show that such an ambient abelian category of an additive regular category \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$ can be found as the heart of a \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{t\}\$-structure on the bounded derived category \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{D{\textasciicircum}b\}({\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\})\$, or as the localization of the category of monomorphisms of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$. In our proof of this last construction, we formulate and prove a version of Auslander's formula for additive regular categories. Whereas a quasi-abelian category is an exact category in a natural way, an additive regular category has a natural one-sided exact structure. Such a one-sided exact category can be 2-universally embedded into its exact hull. We show that the exact hull of an additive regular category is again an additive regular category.},

We develop the theory of thin exact categories, an exact-category analogue of triangulated categories generated by exceptional collections. The right and left abelian envelopes of exact categories are introduced, an example being the category of coherent sheaves on a scheme as the right envelope of the category of vector bundles. The existence of right (left) abelian envelopes is proved for exact categories with projectively (injectively) generating subcategories with weak (co)kernels. We show that highest weight categories are precisely the right/left envelopes of thin categories. Ringel duality is interpreted as a duality between the right and left abelian envelopes of a thin exact category. The duality for thin exact categories is introduced by means of derived categories and Serre functor on them.},

	abstract = {A homomorphism from a graph \$X\$ to a graph \$Y\$ is an adjacency preserving mapping \$f:V(X) {\textbackslash}textbackslashrightarrow V(Y)\$. We consider a nonlocal game in which Alice and Bob are trying to convince a verifier with certainty that a graph \$X\$ admits a homomorphism to \$Y\$. This is a generalization of the well-studied graph coloring game. Via systematic study of quantum homomorphisms we prove new results for graph coloring. Most importantly, we show that the Lov{\textbackslash}textbackslash'\{a\}sz theta number of the complement lower bounds the quantum chromatic number, which itself is not known to be computable. We also show that some of our newly introduced graph parameters, namely quantum independence and clique numbers, can differ from their classical counterparts while others, namely quantum odd girth, cannot. Finally, we show that quantum homomorphisms closely relate to zero-error channel capacity. In particular, we use quantum homomorphisms to construct graphs for which entanglement-assistance increases their one-shot zero-error capacity.},

We give a necessary condition, called strong quadrangularity, for a digraph to be the digraph of a unitary matrix. With the use of such a condition, we show that a line digraph \${\textbackslash}textbackslashoverrightarrow\{L\}D\$ is the pattern of a unitary matrix if and only if D is Eulerian. It follows that, if D is strongly connected and \${\textbackslash}textbackslashoverrightarrow\{L\}D\$ is the digraph of a unitary matrix, then \${\textbackslash}textbackslashoverrightarrow\{L\}D\$ is Hamiltonian. We observe that strong quadrangularity is sufficient to show that disconnected strongly regular graphs are the digraphs of unitary matrices and that n-paths, n-paths with loops at each vertex, n-cycles, directed trees, and trees are not.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with graph colouring games, an example of pseudo-telepathy, in which two players can convince a verifier that a graph {\textbackslash}{textlessI}{\textbackslash}{textgreaterG}{\textbackslash}textless/I{\textbackslash}textgreater is {\textbackslash}{textlessI}{\textbackslash}textgreaterc{\textbackslash}textless/I{\textbackslash}textgreater-colourable where {\textbackslash}{textlessI}{\textbackslash}textgreaterc{\textbackslash}textless/I{\textbackslash}textgreater is less than the chromatic number of the graph. They win the game if they convince the verifier. It is known that the players cannot win if they share only classical information, but they can win in some cases by sharing entanglement. The smallest known graph where the players win in the quantum setting, but not in the classical setting, was found by Galliard, Tapp and Wolf and has 32,768 vertices. It is a connected component of the Hadamard graph {\textbackslash}{textlessI}{\textbackslash}{textgreaterG}{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}{textgreaterN}{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/I{\textbackslash}textgreater with {\textbackslash}{textlessI}{\textbackslash}{textgreaterN}{\textbackslash}textless/I{\textbackslash}textgreater={\textbackslash}{textlessI}{\textbackslash}textgreaterc{\textbackslash}textless/I{\textbackslash}textgreater=16. Their protocol applies only to Hadamard graphs where {\textbackslash}{textlessI}{\textbackslash}{textgreaterN}{\textbackslash}textless/I{\textbackslash}textgreater is a power of 2. We propose a protocol that applies to all Hadamard graphs. Combined with a result of Frankl, this shows that the players can win on any induced subgraph of {\textbackslash}{textlessI}{\textbackslash}{textgreaterG}{\textbackslash}textless/I{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater12{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater having 1609 vertices, with {\textbackslash}{textlessI}{\textbackslash}textgreaterc{\textbackslash}textless/I{\textbackslash}textgreater=12. Moreover combined with a result of Godsil and Newman, our result shows that all Hadamard graphs {\textbackslash}{textlessI}{\textbackslash}{textgreaterG}{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}{textgreaterN}{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/I{\textbackslash}textgreater ({\textbackslash}{textlessI}{\textbackslash}{textgreaterN}{\textbackslash}textless/I{\textbackslash}textgreater ≥ 12) and {\textbackslash}{textlessI}{\textbackslash}textgreaterc{\textbackslash}textless/I{\textbackslash}textgreater={\textbackslash}{textlessI}{\textbackslash}{textgreaterN}{\textbackslash}textless/I{\textbackslash}textgreater yield pseudo-telepathy games.},

We thus recover earlier results of Tsirelson and formulate a new approach for the study of quantum correlations. To do this we formulate a general framework for the study of operator systems arising from discrete groups. We study in detail the operator system of the free group {TeX}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{F\}\_n\} on n generators, as well as the operator systems of the free products of finitely many copies of the two-element group {TeX}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}\_2\} . We examine various tensor products of group operator systems, including the minimal, the maximal, and the commuting tensor products. We introduce a new tensor product in the category of operator systems and formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for its equality to the commuting tensor product in the case of group operator systems.},

We characterize injective W∗-algebras by a matricial order condition. We illustrate the matricial Hahn-Banach principle by three applications: (1) Let A, B, b be unital C∗-algebras, b a subalgebra of A and B, B injective. If ϑ: A → B is a completely bounded self-adjoint b-bihomomorphism, then it can be expressed as the difference of two completely positive b-bihomomorphism. (2) Let M be a W∗-algebra, containing 1H, on a Hilbert space H. If M is finite and hyperfinite, there exists an invariant expectation mapping P of B(H) onto M′. P is an extension of the center trace. (3) Combes [7] proved, that a lower semicontinuous scalar weight on a C∗-algebra is the upper envelope of bounded positive functionals. We generalize this result to unbounded completely positive mappings with values in an injective W∗-algebra.},

	abstract = {We study the class of pseudocompact C*-algebras, which are the logical limits of finite-dimensional C*-algebras. The pseudocompact C*-algebras are unital, stably finite, real rank zero, stable rank one, and tracial. We show that the pseudocompact C*-algebras have trivial K\_1 groups and the Dixmier property. The class is stable under direct sums, tensoring by finite-dimensional C*-algebras, taking corners, and taking centers. We give an explicit axiomatization of the commutative pseudocompact C*-algebras. We also study the subclass of pseudomatricial C*-algebras, which have unique tracial states, strict comparison of projections, and trivial centers. We give some information about the K\_0 groups of the pseudomatricial C*-algebras.},

This leads to the classification, in terms of K-theory and traces, of the isomorphism classes of countably generated Hilbert modules over such algebras, and to a similar classification for the closures of unitary orbits of self-adjoint elements. We also obtain a structure theorem for the Cuntz semigroup in this setting, and prove a conjecture of Blackadar and Handelman: the lower semicontinuous dimension functions are weakly dense in the space of all dimension functions. These results continue to hold in the broader setting of unital simple {ASH} algebras with slow dimension growth and stable rank one. Our main tool is a sharp bound on the radius of comparison of a recursive subhomogeneous C*-algebra. This is also used to construct uncountably many non-Morita-equivalent simple separable amenable C*-algebras with the same K-theory and tracial state space, providing a C*-algebraic analogue of {McDuff}’s uncountable family of {II}1 factors. We prove in passing that the range of the radius of comparison is exhausted by simple C*-algebras.},

The weakest condition of the three, weakly purely infinite, is shown to be equivalent to the absence of quasitraces in an ultrapower of the C*-algebra. The three conditions may be equivalent for all C*-algebras, and we prove this to be the case for C*-algebras that are either simple, of real rank zero, or approximately divisible.},

The size of this set, surprisingly enough, depends on the length (k+1) of the arithmetic progression under consideration. In an ergodic system, for k=2 and k=3, this set is syndetic, while for k≥4 it is not. The main tool is a decomposition result for the multicorrelation sequence {TeX}{\textbackslash}textbackslashint\{f(x)f(Tˆ\{n\}x)f(Tˆ\{2n\}x)\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashldots\} f(Tˆ\{kn\}x) {\textbackslash}textbackslash,d{\textbackslash}textbackslashmu(x)\}, where k and n are positive integers and f is a bounded measurable function. We also derive combinatorial consequences of these results, for example showing that for a set of integers E with upper Banach density d *(E){\textbackslash}textgreater0 and for all ε{\textbackslash}textgreater0, the set {TeX}{\textbackslash}textbackslashbig{\textbackslash}textbackslash\{n{\textbackslash}textbackslashin{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashcolon\} dˆ*{\textbackslash}textbackslashbig(E{\textbackslash}textbackslashcap(E+n){\textbackslash}textbackslashcap(E+2n){\textbackslash}textbackslashcap(E+3n){\textbackslash}textbackslashbig) {\textbackslash}textgreater dˆ*(E)ˆ4-{\textbackslash}textbackslashepsilon{\textbackslash}textbackslashbig{\textbackslash}textbackslash\} is syndetic.},

It follows that the measure groupoid constructed from the equivalence relation s ∼ sg on E may be simply described in terms of the measure groupoid made from the action of some countable group. Some simplifications are made in Mackey's theory of measure groupoids. A natural notion of “approximate finiteness” ({AF}) is introduced for nonsingular actions of G, and results are developed parallel to those for countable groups; several classes of examples arising naturally are shown to be {AF}. Results on “skew product” group actions are obtained, generalizing the countable case, and partially answering a question of Mackey. We also show that a group-measure space factor obtained from a continuous group action is isomorphic (as a von Neumann algebra) to one obtained from a discrete group action.},

	abstract = {We exhibit natural classes of Polish topological groups such that every continuous action of on a compact space has a fixed point, and observe that every group with this property provides a solution (in the negative) to a 1969 problem by Robert Ellis, as the Ellis semigroup of the universal minimal -flow , being trivial, is not isomorphic with the greatest -ambit. Further refining our construction, we obtain a Polish topological group acting freely on the universal minimal flow yet such that and are not isomorphic. We also display Polish topological groups acting effectively but not freely on their universal minimal flows. In fact, we can produce examples of groups of all three types having any prescribed infinite weight. Our examples lead to dynamical conclusions for some groups of importance in analysis. For instance, both the full group of permutations of an infinite set, equipped with the pointwise topology, and the unitary group of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space with the strong operator topology admit no free action on a compact space, and the circle forms the universal minimal flow for the topological group of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms. It also follows that a closed subgroup of an amenable topological group need not be amenable.},

This result leads to new classes of groups that have property A. In particular, groups are of property A if they act cocompactly on locally finite property A spaces of bounded geometry with any stabilizer of property A. Specializing the definition of relative property A, an analogue definition of relative amenability for discrete groups is introduced and similar results are obtained.},

We establish the existence of universal actions for any given Polish group, extending a result of Mackey and Varadarajan for the locally compact case. We prove an analog of Tarski's theorem on paradoxical decompositions by showing that the existence of an invariant Borel probability measure is equivalent to the nonexistence of paradoxical decompositions with countably many Borel pieces. We show that various natural versions of the Topological Vaught Conjecture are equivalent with each other and, in the case of the group of permutations of , with the model-theoretic Vaught Conjecture for infinitary logic; this depends on our identification of the universal action for that group.},

Let Ω be its tiling space with canonical transversal Ξ\{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashXi}\} . The tiling equivalence relation {RΞ}\{R\_{\textbackslash}{textbackslashXi}\} is the set of pairs of tilings in Ξ\{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashXi}\} which are translates of each others, with a certain (étale) topology. In this paper {RΞ}\{R\_{\textbackslash}{textbackslashXi}\} is reconstructed as a generalized “tail equivalence” on a Bratteli diagram, with its standard {AF} -relation as a subequivalence relation. Using a generalization of the Anderson–Putnam complex (Bellissard et al. in Commun. Math. Phys. 261:1–41, 2006) Ω is identified with the inverse limit of a sequence of finite {CW}-complexes. A Bratteli diagram B\{\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal B\}\} is built from this sequence, and its set of infinite paths ∂B\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashpartial \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal B\}\} is homeomorphic to Ξ\{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashXi}\} . The diagram B\{\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal B\}\} is endowed with a horizontal structure: additional edges that encode the adjacencies of patches in T. This allows to define an étale equivalence relation {RB}\{R\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal B\}\} on ∂B\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashpartial \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal B\}\} which is homeomorphic to {RΞ}\{R\_{\textbackslash}{textbackslashXi}\} , and contains the {AF}-relation of “tail equivalence”.},

	abstract = {Ramsey type theorems are theorems of the form: “if certain sets are partitioned at least one of the parts has some particular property”. In its finite form, Ramsey's theory will ask how big the partitioned set should be to assure this fact. Proofs of such theorems usually require a process of multiple choice, so that this apparently “pure combinatoric” field is rich in proofs that use ideal guides in making the choices. Typically they may be ultrafilters or points in the compactification of the given set. It is, therefore, not surprising that nonstandard elements are much more natural guides in some of the proofs and in the general abstract treatment. In Section 1 we start off with some very natural examples of Ramsey type exercises that illustrate our idea. In Section 2 we give a nonstandard proof of the infinite Ramsey theorem. Section 3 tries to do the same for Hindman's theorem, and points out, where nonstandard analysis must use some hard standard facts to make the proof go through. In Section 4 we describe a general theory of “Ramsey Properties”, identifying a Ramsey Property with its nonstandard kernel in the enlargement. In Section 5 nonstandard analysis is used again to deduce the finite Ramsey theorems from their infinite counterpart. More generally, a “compactness theorem” is proved to work for all theorems of this type.},

	abstract = {This is mainly an expository text on the Haagerup property for countable groupoids equipped with a quasi-invariant measure, aiming to complete an article of Jolissaint devoted to the study of this property for probability measure preserving countable equivalence relations. We show that our definition is equivalent to the one given by Ueda in terms of the associated inclusion of von Neumann algebras. It makes obvious the fact that treeability implies the Haagerup property for such groupoids. For the sake of completeness, we also describe, or recall, the connections with amenability and Kazhdan property (T).},

As corollaries we get sufficient conditions for Baireness and weak α-favorability of the graph topology of Brandi and Ceppitelli introduced for applications in differential equations, as well as of the Fell hyperspace topology. The relationship between τC, the compact-open and Fell topologies, respectively is studied; moreover, a topological game is introduced and studied in order to facilitate the exposition of the above results.},

	abstract = {This paper is a contribution to a new direction in descriptive set theory that is being extensively pursued over the last decade or so. It deals with the development of the theory of definable actions of Polish groups, the structure and classification of their orbit spaces, and the closely related study of definable equivalence relations. This study is motivated by basic foundational questions, like understanding the nature of complete classification of mathematical objects, up to some notion of equivalence, by invariants, and creating a mathematical framework for measuring the complexity of such classification problems. (For an extensive discussion of these matters, see, e.g., Hjorth [00], Kechris [99, 00a].) This theory is developed within the context of descriptive set theory, which provides the basic underlying concepts and methods. On the other hand, in view of its broad scope, there are natural interactions of it with other areas of mathematics, such as model theory, recursion theory, the theory of topological groups and their representations, topological dynamics, ergodic theory, and operator algebras},

These spaces naturally generalize much of the classical descriptive set theory of Polish spaces to the non-Hausdorff setting. We show that a subspace of a quasi-Polish space is quasi-Polish if and only if it is Π 2 0 in the Borel hierarchy. Quasi-Polish spaces can be characterized within the framework of Type-2 Theory of Effectivity as precisely the countably based spaces that have an admissible representation with a Polish domain. They can also be characterized domain theoretically as precisely the spaces that are homeomorphic to the subspace of all non-compact elements of an ω-continuous domain. Every countably based locally compact sober space is quasi-Polish, hence every ω-continuous domain is quasi-Polish. A metrizable space is quasi-Polish if and only if it is Polish. We show that the Borel hierarchy on an uncountable quasi-Polish space does not collapse, and that the Hausdorff–Kuratowski theorem generalizes to all quasi-Polish spaces.},

	abstract = {The set M ∞(Z) of countably infinite square matrices over Z forms a (partial, non-associative) groupoid. The authors, with Davies, showed in 1996 that every finite or countable groupoid embeds in M ∞(Z). This is a non-associative analogue of the elementary result that every finite or countable semigroup embeds in row-finite matrices over Z, although the proof is very different. This article considers corresponding questions about ⋆-embeddings of groupoids (G, ⋆) with involution ⋆. The two main results here are that (i) there is an improper involution ⊛ on M ∞(Z) such that every countable (G, ⋆) embeds in (M ∞(Z), ⊛), and (ii) every countable partial ⋆-groupoid obtained by omitting all products g ⋆ g from (G, ⋆) embeds in (M ∞(Z), T), where T is the transpose. It is also noted that, even in the finite associative case, not every finite semigroup with proper involution ⋆-embeds in an M n (Z) with a proper involution. However, with respect to a version of ⊛ acting on square matrices of finite even order, as an analogue of (i) apparently new even for the finite associative case, it is shown that (iii) every finite ⋆-semigroup embeds into some (M 2n (Z), ⊛). All these results have corresponding versions for k- and (k, ⋆)-algebras. As an application, these embedding results are used to provide a much simpler and more general way of finding examples, like those constructed by Sivakumar in 2006, of infinite matrices having uncountably many distinct groups and Moore–Penrose generalized inverses which are not classical inverses.},

We prove theorems comparing these three ranks and construct subgroups with prescribed ranks. In particular, answering a question of Mauldin, we establish the existence of Borel subgroups which are Π α 0 -complete, α ⩾ 3 , and Σ α 0 -complete, α ⩾ 2 , in each uncountable Polish group. Also, for every α \&lt; ω 1 we construct an Abelian, locally compact, second countable group which is densely divisible and of Ulm length α + 1 .

This has led to a good understanding of such things as complex homomorphisms and ideals (but not subalgebras) when the underlying metric space is compact. Taking a cue from the recent observation that Lipschitz spaces are order-complete (N. Weaver, Pacific J. Math. 164 (1994), 179-193), we here investigate these topics under the hypothesis of order continuity or order closure in place of norm continuity or norm closure. We obtain simple characterizations of order-continuous complex homomorphisms and order-complete subalgebras and ideals, even when the underlying metric space is not compact. In particular, we show that order-complete subalgebras and quotients by order-complete ideals are themselves Lipschitz spaces.},

Rieffel, up to complete order isomorphisms preserving the Lip-seminorm, is not complete w.r.t. the matricial quantum Gromov–Hausdorff distance introduced by D. Kerr. This is shown by exhibiting a Cauchy sequence whose limit, which always exists as an operator system, is not completely order isomorphic to any C*C*-algebra. Conditions ensuring the existence of a C*C*-structure on the limit are considered, making use of the notion of ultraproduct. More precisely, a necessary and sufficient condition is given for the existence, on the limiting operator system, of a C*C*-product structure inherited from the approximating C*C*-algebras. Such condition can be considered as a generalisation of the ff-Leibniz conditions introduced by Kerr and Li. Furthermore, it is shown that our condition is not necessary for the existence of a C*C*-structure tout court , namely there are cases in which the limit is a C*C*-algebra, but the C*C*-structure is not inherited.},

In particular, if X is a subspace of a C*C*-algebra A , and if a∈Aa∈A satisfies {aX}⊂{XaX}⊂X, then we show that the function x↦axx↦ax on X is automatically weak** continuous if either (a) X is a dual operator space, or (b) a*X⊂Xa*X⊂X and X is a dual Banach space. These results hinge on a generalization to Banach modules of Tomiyama's famous theorem on contractive projections onto a C*C*-subalgebra. Applications include a new characterization of the σσ-weakly closed (possibly nonunital and nonselfadjoint) operator algebras, and a generalization of the theory of W*W*-modules to the framework of modules over such algebras. We also give a Banach module characterization of σσ-weakly closed spaces of operators which are invariant under the action of a von Neumann algebra.},

	title = {On the growth of \$Lˆ2\$-invariants for sequences of lattices in Lie groups},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.2961},
	abstract = {We study the asymptotic behavior of Betti numbers, twisted torsion and other spectral invariants of sequences of locally symmetric spaces. Our main results are uniform versions of the {DeGeorge}–Wallach Theorem, of a theorem of Delorme and various other limit multiplicity theorems. The idea is to adapt Benjamini-Schramm convergence ({BS}-convergence), originally introduced for sequences of finite graphs of bounded degree, to sequences of Riemannian manifolds. Exploiting the rigidity theory of higher rank lattices, we show that when volume tends to infinity, higher rank locally symmetric spaces {BS}-converge to their universal cover. We prove that {BS}-convergence implies a convergence of certain spectral invariants, the Plancherel measures. This leads to convergence of volume normalized multiplicities of unitary representations and Betti numbers. We also prove a strong quantitative version of {BS}-convergence for arbitrary sequences of congruence covers of a fixed arithmetic manifold. This leads to upper estimates on the rate of convergence of normalized Betti numbers in the spirit of Sarnak-Xue. An important role in our approach is played by the notion of Invariant Random Subroups. For higher rank simple Lie groups \$G\$, exploiting rigidity theory, and in particular the Nevo-Stuck-Zimmer theorem and Kazhdan`s property (T), we are able to analyze the space of {IRSs} of \$G\$. In rank one, the space of {IRSs} is much richer. We build some explicit 2 and 3-dimensional real hyperbolic {IRSs} that are not induced from lattices and employ techniques of Gromov–Piatetski-Shapiro to construct similar examples in higher dimension.},

The existence depends on the \$Lˆ2\$-Betti numbers of \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$, its subgroups and of a uniform lattice of \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashIsom}(X)\$. As an application, we show the existence of a uniform positive lower bound on the Cheeger constant of any manifold of the form \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashHˆ}4/{\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$ where \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashHˆ}4\$ is real hyperbolic 4-space and \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}{\textbackslash}textless{\textbackslash}{textbackslashIsom}({\textbackslash}{textbackslashHˆ}4)\$ is discrete and isomorphic to a subgroup of the fundamental group of a complete finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifold. Via Patterson-Sullivan theory, this implies the existence of a uniform positive upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the conical limit set of such a \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$ when \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$ is geometrically finite. Another application shows the existence of a uniform positive lower bound on the zero-th eigenvalue of the Laplacian of \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashHˆn}/{\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$ over all discrete free groups \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}{\textbackslash}textless{\textbackslash}{textbackslashIsom}({\textbackslash}{textbackslashHˆn})\$ whenever \$n{\textbackslash}textbackslashge 4\$ is even (the bound depends on \$n\$).

A necessary and sufficient algorithmic combinatorial condition is found for deciding when a polynomial endomorphism λuλu restricts to an automorphism of the canonical diagonal {MASA}. Some steps towards a general criterion for invertibility of λuλu on the whole of {OnOn} are also taken. A condition for verifying invertibility of a certain subclass of polynomial endomorphisms is given. First examples of polynomial automorphisms of {OnOn} not inner related to those induced by unitaries from the core {UHF} subalgebra are exhibited, for every n≥2n≥2. In particular, the image of the Weyl group in the outer automorphism group of {OnOn} is strictly larger than the image of the restricted Weyl group analyzed in previous papers.

This is in strong contrast to the case of the isomorphism relation, which as an equivalence relation on graphs (or on any class of countable structures consisting of the models of a sentence of ℒω1ω) is far from complete (see [5, 2]). In this article we strengthen the results of [5] by showing that not only does bi-embeddability give rise to analytic equivalence relations which are complete under Borel reducibility, but in fact any analytic equivalence relation is Borel equivalent to such a relation. This result and the techniques introduced answer questions raised in [5] about the comparison between isomorphism and bi-embeddability. Finally, as in [5] our results apply not only to classes of countable structures defined by sentences of ℒω1ω, but also to discrete metric or ultrametric Polish spaces, compact metrizable topological spaces and separable Banach spaces, with various notions of embeddability appropriate for these classes, as well as to actions of Polish monoids.},

The technique of proof also shows that M does not admit a hyperbolic structure.},

These results strengthen a theorem of Jayne and Rogers and answer some questions of Steprans. Their proofs use effective descriptive set theory as well as infinite Borel games on the integers. An important role in the proofs is played by what we call, in analogy with being Wadge complete, complete semicontinuous functions. As another application of our study of complete semicontinuous functions, we generalize some recent theorems of Jackson and Mauldin, and van Mill and Pol concerning measures viewed as examples of complicated semicontinuous functions. We also prove that a Borel set is either or there is a continuous injection such that for any set , is meager. We show analogous results for Borel functions. These theorems give a new proof of a result of Stern, strengthen some results of Laczkovich, and improve the estimates for cardinal coefficients studied by Cichon, Morayne, Pawlikowski, and the author.},

We also provide a description of characteristically simple groups and of groups all of whose proper quotients are compact.

Our definition is based on convexity properties of the relative entropy Ent(⋅{\textbackslash}textbarm) Ent\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashleft( \{ {\textbackslash}textbackslashcdot {\textbackslash}textbackslashleft{\textbackslash}textbar m {\textbackslash}textbackslashright.\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashright)\} regarded as a function on the L 2-Wasserstein space of probability measures on the metric space (M,d) \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashleft( \{M,d\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashright)\} . Among others, we show that Curv−−−−(M,d,m) {\textbackslash}textbackslashunderline\{\{Curv\}\} \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashleft( \{M,d,m\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashright)\} ⩾ K implies estimates for the volume growth of concentric balls. For Riemannian manifolds, Curv−−−−(M,d,m) {\textbackslash}textbackslashunderline\{\{Curv\}\} \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashleft( \{M,d,m\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashright)\} ⩾ K if and only if {RicM}(ξ,ξ) Ric\_\{M\} \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashleft( \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashxi ,{\textbackslash}textbackslashxi \} {\textbackslash}textbackslashright)\} ⩾ K {\textbackslash}textbarξ{\textbackslash}textbar2 \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashleft{\textbackslash}textbar {\textbackslash}textbackslashxi {\textbackslash}textbackslashright{\textbackslash}textbar\}ˆ\{2\} for all ξ∈{TM} {\textbackslash}textbackslashxi {\textbackslash}textbackslashin {TM} . The crucial point is that our lower curvature bounds are stable under an appropriate notion of D-convergence of metric measure spaces. We define a complete and separable length metric D on the family of all isomorphism classes of normalized metric measure spaces. The metric D has a natural interpretation, based on the concept of optimal mass transportation. We also prove that the family of normalized metric measure spaces with doubling constant ⩽ C is closed under D-convergence. Moreover, the family of normalized metric measure spaces with doubling constant ⩽ C and diameter ⩽ L is compact under D-convergence.},

	abstract = {Let A⊆M⊆B(L2(M))A⊆M⊆B(L2(M)) be a maximal abelian self-adjoint subalgebra (masa) in a type {II}1 factor M in its standard representation. The abelian von Neumann algebra {AA} generated by A and {JAJ} has a type I commutant which contains the projection {eA}∈{AeA}∈A onto L2(A)L2(A). Then A′(1−{eA})A′(1−{eA}) decomposes into a direct sum of type {InIn} algebras for n∈\{1,2,…,∞\}n∈\{1,2,…,∞\}, and those n 's which occur in the direct sum form a set called the Pukánszky invariant, Puk(A)Puk(A), also denoted {PukM}(A){PukM}(A) when the containing factor is ambiguous. In this paper we show that this invariant can take on the values S∪\{∞\}S∪\{∞\} when M is both a free group factor and the hyperfinite factor, and where S is an arbitrary subset of {NN}. The only previously known values for masas in free group factors were \{∞\}\{∞\} and \{1,∞\}\{1,∞\}, and some values of the form S∪\{∞\}S∪\{∞\} are new also for the hyperfinite factor. We also consider a more refined invariant (that we will call the measure-multiplicity invariant), which was considered recently by Neshveyev and Størmer and has been known to experts for a long time. We use the measure-multiplicity invariant to distinguish two masas in a free group factor, both having Pukánszky invariant \{n,∞\}\{n,∞\}, for arbitrary n∈Nn∈N.},

The fact that Theorem G, is true was announced in 2005 by author without proof, and was proved by S. Solecki in [S. Solecki, Extending partial isometries, Israel J. Math. 150 (2005) 315–332] (see also [V. Pestov, The isometry group of the Urysohn space as a Lévy group, Topology Appl. 154 (10) (2007) 2173–2184; V. Pestov, A theorem of Hrushevski–Solecki–Vershik applied to uniform and coarse embeddings of the Urysohn metric space, math/0702207]) based on the previous complicate results of other authors. The theorem is generalization of the Hrushevski's theorem about the globalization of the partial isomorphisms of finite graphs. We intend to give a constructive proof in the same spirit for metric spaces elsewhere. We also give the strengthening of homogeneity of Urysohn space and in the last paragraph we gave a short survey of the various constructions of Urysohn space including the new proof of the construction of shift invariant universal distance matrix from [P. Cameron, A. Vershik, Some isometry groups of Urysohn spaces, Ann. Pure Appl. Logic 143 (1–3) (2006) 70–78].},

Thus, separable Banach spaces up to isomorphism provide complete invariants for a great number of mathematical structures up to their corresponding notion of isomorphism. The same is shown to hold for: (1) complete separable metric spaces up to uniform homeomorphism, (2) separable Banach spaces up to Lipschitz isomorphism and (3) up to (complemented) biembeddability, (4) Polish groups up to topological isomorphism, and (5) Schauder bases up to permutative equivalence. Some of the constructions rely on methods recently developed by S. Argyros and P. Dodos.},

That is, the ones with the version of the Rokhlin property contain a dense \$G\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashdelta\}\$-subset of the set of all such automorphisms (or actions). Specifically, we prove the following. If \$A\$ is stable under tensoring with the Jiang-Su algebra \$Z,\$ and has tracial rank zero, then automorphisms with the tracial Rokhlin property are generic. If \$A\$ has tracial rank zero, or, more generally, \$A\$ is tracially approximately divisible together with a technical condition, then automorphisms with the tracial Rokhlin property are generic among the approximately inner automorphisms. If \$A\$ is stable under tensoring with the Cuntz algebra \$\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{O\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty\}\$ or with a {UHF} algebra of infinite type, then actions of \$\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}\}ˆd\$ on \$A\$ with the Rokhlin property are generic among all actions of \$\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}\}ˆd.\$ We further give a related but more restricted result for actions of finite groups.},

A consequence of various well-known selection theorems is that if r is a continuous affine map from E onto a metric space F, then there exists a Borel-measurable selection for r. In this paper, we give a purely functional analytic proof of this fact. For general metric spaces E such selections do not always exist, and the technical arguments, which have seemed to be necessary in each special case, are quite delicate. The spaces encountered in functional analysis are frequently homeomorphic to the set of extreme points of a compact set, so that our theorem gives a more universally applicable result for functional analysts. Many of the selection theorems needed in unitary representation theory are shown to be consequences of the general result in this paper.},

This paper consists of two major parts: In section 2 and 3, we study the permanence properties and give a complete classification of tracial Rokhlin property for product-type actions; In section 4 and 5, we introduce the weak tracial Rokhlin property for actions on non-simple C*-algebras. We prove that when the action has the weak tracial Rokhlin property and the crossed product is simple, the properties on \$A\$ of having tracial rank \${\textbackslash}textbackslashleq k\$, or real rank 0, or stable rank 1, can be inherited by the crossed product.},

In particular, the question is considered whether, for any simple separable A∈{TACA}∈{TAC}, there is a C*-algebra B which is a simple inductive limit of certain basic homogeneous C*-algebras together with C*-algebras in {CC}, such that the Elliott invariant of A is isomorphic to the Elliott invariant of B. An interesting case of this question is answered. In the final part of the paper, the question is also considered which properties of C*-algebras are inherited by tracial approximation.

Under mild conditions, we show that this pre-ordered crossed product is the essentially unique pre-ordered Banach algebra for which such a bijection exists. Finally, we study pre-ordered generalized Beurling algebras.

If \$A\$ has a bounded left approximate identity, and \$R\$ consists of non-degenerate continuous covariant representations only, then the non-degenerate bounded representations of the crossed product are in bijection with the non-degenerate \$R\$-continuous covariant representations of the system. This bijection, which is the main result of the paper, is also established for involutive Banach algebra dynamical systems and then yields the well-known representation theoretical correspondence for the crossed product \$Cˆ*\$-algebra as commonly associated with a \$Cˆ*\$-algebra dynamical system as a special case. Taking the algebra \$A\$ to be the base field, the crossed product construction provides, for a given non-empty class of Banach spaces, a Banach algebra with a relatively simple structure and with the property that its non-degenerate contractive representations in the spaces from that class are in bijection with the isometric strongly continuous representations of \$G\$ in those spaces. This generalizes the notion of a group \$Cˆ*\$-algebra, and may likewise be used to translate issues concerning group representations in a class of Banach spaces to the context of a Banach algebra, simpler than \$Lˆ1(G)\$, where more functional analytic structure is present.},

In this paper the theory is developed further. We consider the dependence of the crossed product on the class \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\}\$ and its essential uniqueness. Next we study generalized Beurling algebras: weighted Bochner spaces of \$A\$-valued functions on \$G\$ with a continuous multiplication. Though not Banach algebras in general, they are isomorphic to a crossed product of a Banach algebra, and the earlier work therefore predicts the structure of their representations. Classical results for the usual Beurling (Banach) algebras of scalar valued functions are then retrieved as special cases. We also show how, e.g., an anti-covariant pair of anti-representations of \$A\$ and \$G\$ can be viewed as a covariant pair for a related Banach algebra dynamical system, so that the earlier work becomes applicable to classes of such other pairs. After including material on the representations of the projective tensor product of Banach algebras, we combine this idea with the results already obtained and describe the two-sided modules over the generalized Beurling algebras, where again specializing to the scalars gives a classical result.},

M λ(Q) is identified with a subfactor inside the centralizer algebra of the canonical free product state on Q ⋆ M N (ℂ). Its structure is described by “infinite” semicircular elements as in \{xc[32]\}. The irreducible subfactor inclusions obtained by this method are similar to the first irreducible subfactor inclusions, of index in [\{xc4\},∞) constructed in \{xc[24]\}, starting with the Jones’ subfactors inclusion {TeXRˆs} {\textbackslash}textbackslashsubseteq R , s gt; 4. In the present paper, since the inclusion we start with has a simpler structure, it is easier to control the algebra structure of the subfactor inclusions. If the weights correspond to a unitary, finite-dimensional representation of a Woronowicz’s compact quantum group G, then the factor M λ(Q) is contained in the fixed point algebra of an action of the quantum group on Q ⋆ {MN}(ℂ), with equality if G is {SUq}(N), (or {SOq}(3) when N = 2). By Takesaki duality, the factor Mλ(L({FN})) is Morita equivalent to {TeX}{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{L\} (F ∞). This method gives also another approach to find, as also recently proved in \{xc[36]\}, irreducible subfactors of {TeX}{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{L\} (F ∞) for index values bigger than 4.},

This characterization has applications to the study of generalized traces (linear functionals vanishing on the commutator ideal [I,B(H)]) and to the study of the B(H)-ideal lattice and certain special sublattices. The structure of commutator ideals is essential for investigating traces which in turn is relevant for the calculation of the cyclic homology and the algebraic K-theory of operator ideals.},

The Roelcke uniformity (or lower uniformity) on a topological group is the greatest lower bound of the left and right uniformities. A group is Roelcke-precompact if it is precompact with respect to the Roelcke uniformity. Many naturally arising non-Abelian topological groups are Roelcke-precompact and hence have a natural compactification. We use such compactifications to prove that some groups of isometries are minimal. In particular, if U 1 is the Urysohn universal metric space of diameter 1, the group Iso ( U 1 ) of all self-isometries of U 1 is Roelcke-precompact, topologically simple and minimal. We also show that every topological group is a subgroup of a minimal topologically simple Roelcke-precompact group of the form Iso ( M ) , where M is an appropriate non-separable version of the Urysohn space.},

In this paper, we give a systematic method of constructing noncompactifiable G-spaces. We show that the class of non-V-groups is large and contains all second countable (even ℵ0-bounded) nonlocally precompact groups. This establishes the existence of monothetic (even cyclic) non-V-groups, answering a question of the first author.

If we drop the assumption {thatAhas} an identity and if we {allowΔto} have values in the so-called multiplier {algebraM}(A⊗A), we get a natural extension of the notion of a Hopf algebra. We call this a multiplier Hopf algebra. The motivating example is the algebra of complex functions with finite support on a group with the comultiplication defined as dual to the product in the group. Also for these multiplier Hopf algebras, there is a natural notion of left and right invariance for linear functionals (called integrals in Hopf algebra theory). We show that, if such invariant functionals exist, they are unique (up to a scalar) and faithful. For a regular multiplier Hopf algebra (A, Δ) (i.e., with invertible antipode) with invariant functionals, we construct, in a canonical way, the dual (Â, Δ). It is again a regular multiplier Hopf algebra with invariant functionals. It is also shown that the dual of (Â, Δ) is canonically isomorphic with the original multiplier Hopf algebra (A, Δ). It is possible to generalize many aspects of abstract harmonic analysis here. One can define the Fourier transform; one can prove Plancherel's formula. Because any finite-dimensional Hopf algebra is a regular multiplier Hopf algebra and has invariant functionals, our duality theorem applies to all finite-dimensional Hopf algebras. Then it coincides with the usual duality for such Hopf algebras. But our category of multiplier Hopf algebras also includes, in a certain way, the discrete (quantum) groups and the compact (quantum) groups. Our duality includes the duality between discrete quantum groups and compact quantum groups. In particular, it includes the duality between compact abelian groups and discrete abelian groups. One of the nice features of our theory is that we have an extension of this duality to the non-abelian case, but within one category. This is shown in the last section of our paper where we introduce the algebras of compact type and the algebras of discrete type. We prove that also these are dual to each other. We treat an example that is sufficiently general to illustrate most of the different features of our theory. It is also possible to construct the quantum double of Drinfel'd within this category. This provides a still wider class of examples. So, we obtain many more than just the compact and discrete quantum within this setting.},

Our discussion is restricted to families of uniform tight frames obtained from sampling along a path in a given d -dimensional Hilbert space. We prove upper and lower bounds for the maximal Euclidean reconstruction error in terms of geometric quantities for the path. While the upper bounds are independent of the particular quantizer used, the lower bounds require quantizers that assume only integer multiples of a step-size δ (mid-tread). We calculate these bounds for various known frame families obtained from sampling and introduce new such paths, the so-called d -circles and semicircles frames. The latter give a slight improvement in the upper bound over the harmonic frames. The bounds we derive for N frame vectors in dimension d and quantization step-size δ are of the order δd3/2/Nδd3/2/N, with numerical constants that are comparable to that of coordinatewise application of the sigma–delta algorithm.},

In the time when over-specialization and terminology fences isolate researchers, this Dictionary try to be "centripedal" and "oikoumeni", providing some access and altitude of vision but without taking the route of scientific vulgarisation. This attempted balance is the main philosophy of this Dictionary which defined its structure and style.Key features:- Unicity: it is the first book treating the basic notion of Distance in whole generality.- Interdisciplinarity: this Dictionary is larger in scope than majority of thematic dictionaries.- Encyclopedicity: while an Encyclopedia of Distances seems now too difficult to produce, this book (by its scope, short introductions and organization) provides the main material for it and for future tutorials on some parts of this material.- Applicability: the distances, as well as distance-related notions and paradigms, are provided in ready-to-use fashion.- Worthiness: the need and urgency for such dictionary was great in several huge areas, esp. Information Retrieval, Image Analysis, Speech Recognition and Biology.- Accessibility: the definitions are easy to locate by subject or, in Index, by alphabetic order; the introductions and definitions are reader-friendly and maximally independent one from another; still the text is structured, in the 3D {HTML} style, by hyperlink-like boldfaced references to similar definitions.* Covers a large range of subjects in pure and applied mathematics* Designed to be easily applied–the distances and distance-related notions and paradigms are ready to use* Helps users quickly locate definitions by subject or in alphabetical order; stand-alone entries include references to other entries and sources for further investigation},

In many cases, the L2L2-Betti numbers of a lattice are proportional to those of the ambient locally compact group, yielding new results for certain classes of lattices, including arithmetic lattices and Kac–Moody lattices. Cet article présente quelques résultats de la thèse de lʼauteur, « L2L2-Betti Numbers of Locally Compact Groups », dans laquelle la définition des nombres L2L2 de Betti des groupes dénombrables a été généralisée au cas des groupes localement compacts unimodulaires. Dans de nombreux cas, les nombres L2L2 de Betti dʼun réseau quelconque dans un groupe localement compact sont proportionnels à ceux du groupe localement compact ambiant. On peut donc utiliser des théories puissantes concernant certaines classes de groupes localement compacts pour obtenir des calculs des nombres L2L2 de Betti de leurs réseaux, en particulier les réseaux arithmétiques et les réseaux de Kac–Moody.},

In order to describe the crossed product of a C*-algebra A by an action of P by unital endomorphisms we find that we must extend the action to the whole group G.

We then develop a theory of crossed products by interaction groups and compare it to other endomorphism crossed product constructions.},

We discuss homomorphisms from A *(G) to B (H) where H is another locally compact group; and we show that A *(H) contains the image of every completely bounded homomorphism from the Fourier algebra A (H) of any amenable group G. We also show that A *(G) contains all of the idempotents in B (G).

The curvature-dimension condition {CD}(K, N) is stable under convergence. For any triple of real numbers K, N, L the family of normalized metric measure spaces (M, d, m) with {CD}(K, N) and diameter ⩽ L is compact. Condition {CD}(K, N) implies sharp version of the Brunn–Minkowski inequality, of the Bishop–Gromov volume comparison theorem and of the Bonnet–Myers theorem. Moreover, it implies the doubling property and local, scale-invariant Poincaré inequalities on balls. In particular, it allows to construct canonical Dirichlet forms with Gaussian upper and lower bounds for the corresponding heat kernels.},

We introduce the notion of a local class, with the class of finite simplicial complexes as an archetypal example, and in this general context prove the existence of a 0-1 law and other basic model-theoretic results. Constraining to the case where all relations are symmetric, we show that every direct limit of finite groups, and every metrizable profinite group, appears as a subgroup of the automorphism group of the Fraisse limit. Finally, for the specific case of simplicial complexes, we show that the geometric realisation is topologically surprisingly simple: despite the combinatorial complexity of the Fraisse limit, its geometric realisation is homeomorphic to the infinite simplex.},

	abstract = {For \$p {\textbackslash}textbackslashin [1, {\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty),\$ we define and study full and reduced crossed products of algebras of operators on \${\textbackslash}textbackslashsigma\$-finite \$Lˆp\$ spaces by isometric actions of second countable locally compact groups. We give universal properties for both crossed products. When the group is abelian, we prove the existence of a dual action on the full and reduced \$Lˆp\$ operator crossed products. When the group is discrete, we construct a conditional expectation to the original algebra which is faithful in a suitable sense. For a free action of a discrete group on a compact metric space \$X,\$ we identify all traces on the reduced \$Lˆp\$ operator crossed product, and if the action is also minimal we show that the reduced \$Lˆp\$ operator crossed product is simple. We prove that the full and reduced \$Lˆp\$ operator crossed products of an amenable \$Lˆp\$ operator algebra by a discrete amenable group are again amenable. We prove a Pimsner-Voiculescu exact sequence for the K-theory of reduced \$Lˆp\$ operator crossed products by \$\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}\}.\$ We show that the \$Lˆp\$ analogs \$\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{O\}\}\_dˆp\$ of the Cuntz algebras \$\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{O\}\}\_d\$ are stably isomorphic to reduced \$Lˆp\$ operator crossed products of stabilized \$Lˆp\$ {UHF} algebra by \$\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}\},\$ and show that \$K\_0 (\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{O\}\}\_dˆp) {\textbackslash}textbackslashcong \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}\} / (d - 1) \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}\}\$ and \$K\_1 (\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{O\}\}\_dˆp) = 0.\$},

The aim of the workshop was to bring together leading experts in the theory of C* -algebras with promising young researchers in the field, and to provide a stimulating atmosphere for discussions and interactions between the participants. There were 19 one-hour lectures on various topics like - classification of nuclear C* -algebras, - general K-theory for C* -algebras, - exact C* -algebras and exact groups, - C*-algebras associated to (infinite) matrices and C*-correspondences, - noncommutative prob ability theory, - deformation quantization, - group C* -algebras and the Baum-Connes conjecture, giving a broad overview of the latest developments in the field, and serving as a basis for discussions. We, the organizers of the workshop, were greatly pleased with the excellence of the lectures and so were led to the idea of publishing the proceedings of the conference. There are basically two kinds of contributions. On one side there are several articles giving surveys and overviews on new developments and im portant results of the theory, on the other side one finds original articles with interesting new results.},

The main result of this paper is a qualitative description of approximate groups as being essentially finite-by-nilpotent, answering a conjecture of H. Helfgott and E. Lindenstrauss. This may be viewed as a generalisation of the Freiman-Ruzsa theorem on sets of small doubling in the integers to arbitrary groups. We begin by establishing a correspondence principle between approximate groups and locally compact (local) groups that allows us to recover many results recently established in a fundamental paper of Hrushovski. In particular we establish that approximate groups can be approximately modeled by Lie groups. To prove our main theorem we apply some additional arguments essentially due to Gleason. These arose in the solution of Hilbert’s fifth problem in the 1950s. Applications of our main theorem include a finitary refinement of Gromov’s theorem, as well as a generalized Margulis lemma conjectured by Gromov and a result on the virtual nilpotence of the fundamental group of Ricci almost nonnegatively curved manifolds.},

The proof is non-elementary, proceeding by first using an ultraproduct construction to replace the finitary claim on quasirandom groups with an infinitary analogue concerning a limiting group object that we call an ultra quasirandom group, and then using the machinery of idempotent ultrafilters to establish the required mixing property for such groups. Some simpler recurrence theorems (involving tuples such as (x, gx, xg)) are also presented, as well as some further discussion of specific examples of ultra quasirandom groups.},

Indeed the multiplication on A need not be assumed to be associative for this conclusion to follow. Examples are given to show that the condition on the identity is necessary. It follows from the above that the quotient of an operator algebra by a closed two-sided ideal (with the natural matricial structure) is again an operator algebra up to complete isometric isomorphism.},

	abstract = {This paper has a two-fold purpose. Let 1 \&lt; p \&lt; ∞ . We first introduce the p-operator space injective tensor product and study various properties related to this tensor product, including the p-operator space approximation property, for p-operator spaces on L p -spaces. We then apply these properties to the study of the pseudofunction algebra {PF} p ( G ) , the pseudomeasure algebra {PM} p ( G ) , and the Figà–Talamanca–Herz algebra A p ( G ) of a locally compact group G. We show that if G is a discrete group, then most of approximation properties for the reduced group C∗-algebra C λ ∗ ( G ) , the group von Neumann algebra {VN} ( G ) , and the Fourier algebra A ( G ) (related to amenability, weak amenability, and approximation property of G) have the natural p-analogues for {PF} p ( G ) , {PM} p ( G ) , and A p ( G ) , respectively. The p-completely bounded multiplier algebra M cb A p ( G ) plays an important role in this work.},

	abstract = {We study a new dynamical invariant for dicrete groups: the cost. It is a real number in \{1−1/n\}∪[1,∞], bounded by the number of generators of the group, and it is well behaved with respect to finite index subgroups. Namely, the quantities 1 minus the cost are related by multiplying by the index. The cost of every infinite amenable group equals 1. We compute it in some other situations, including free products, free products with amalgamation and {HNN}-extensions over amenable groups and for direct product situations. For instance, the cost of the free group on n generators equals n. We prove that each possible finite value of the cost is achieved by a finitely generated group. It is dynamical because it relies on measure preserving free actions on probability Borel spaces. In most cases, groups have fixed price, which implies that two freely acting groups which define the same orbit partition must have the same cost. It enables us to distinguish the orbit partitions of probability-preserving free actions of free groups of different ranks. At the end of the paper, we give a mercuriale, i.e. a list of costs of different groups. The cost is in fact an invariant of ergodic measure-preserving equivalence relations and is defined using graphings. A treeing is a measurable way to provide every equivalence class (=orbit) with the structure of a simplicial tree, this an example of graphing. Not every relation admits a treeing: we prove that every free action of a cost 1 non-amenable group is not treeable, but we prove that subrelations of treeable relations are treeable. We give examples of relations which cannot be produced by an action of any finitely generated group. The cost of a relation which can be decomposed as a direct product is shown to be 1. We define the notion for a relation to be a free product or an {HNN}-extension and compute the cost for the resulting relation from the costs of the building blocks. The cost is also an invariant of the pairs von Neumann algebra/Cartan subalgebra.},

We prove a general result giving a sufficient condition for invariant universality, and we demonstrate several applications of this theorem by showing that the phenomenon of invariant universality is widespread.

Under mild assumptions on Γ, we prove that in the first case, there is (up to isomorphism of topological groups) a unique generic π(Γ)¯¯¯¯¯¯¯{\textbackslash}textbackslashoverline \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashpi ({\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma} )\} ; in the other two, we show that the generic π(Γ)¯¯¯¯¯¯¯{\textbackslash}textbackslashoverline \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashpi ({\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma} )\} is extremely amenable.

We prove that whenever the group Iso (U){\textbackslash}textbackslashleft( {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{U\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashright) of isometries of Urysohn’s universal complete separable metric space U{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{U\} , equipped with the compact-open topology, acts upon an arbitrary compact space, it has a fixed point. The same is true if U{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{U\} is replaced with any generalized Urysohn metric {spaceU} that is sufficiently homogeneous. Modulo a recent theorem by Uspenskij that every topological group embeds into a topological group of the form Iso(U), our result implies that every topological group embeds into an extremely amenable group (one admitting an invariant multiplicative mean on bounded right uniformly continuous functions). By way of the proof, we show that every topological group is approximated by finite groups in a certain weak sense. Our technique also results in a new proof of the extreme amenability (fixed point on compacta property) for infinite orthogonal groups. Going in the opposite direction, we deduce some Ramsey-type theorems for metric subspaces of Hilbert spaces and for spherical metric spaces from existing results on extreme amenability of infinite unitary groups and groups of isometries of Hilbert spaces.},

	abstract = {Coalgebras of polynomial functors constructed from sets of observable elements have been found useful in modelling various kinds of data types and state-transition systems. This paper continues the study of equational logic and model theory for polynomial coalgebras begun in Goldblatt (in: Advances in Modal Logic, vol. 4, 2001, to appear), where it was shown that Boolean combinations of equations between terms of observable type form a natural language of observable formulas for specifying properties of polynomial coalgebras, and for giving a Hennessy–Milner style logical characterisation of observational indistinguishability (bisimilarity) of states. Here we give a structural characterisation of classes of coalgebras definable by observable formulas. This is an analogue for polynomial coalgebras of Birkhoff's celebrated characterisation of equationally definable classes of abstract algebras as being those closed under homomorphic images, subalgebras, and direct products. The coalgebraic characterisation involves new notions of observational ultraproduct and ultrapower of coalgebras, obtained from the classical construction of ultraproducts by deleting states that assign “nonstandard” values to terms of observable type. A class of polynomial coalgebras is shown to be the class of all models of a set of observable formulas if, and only if, it is closed under images of bisimulation relations, disjoint unions and observational ultrapowers. Observational ultraproducts are also used to discuss compactness—which holds only under limited conditions; to characterise finitely, axiomatisable classes of polynomial coalgebras; and to show that there are axiomatisable classes that are not finitely axiomatisable.},

We show that for m uncountable, the isometry group Iso ( U m ) with the topology of simple convergence is not a universal group of weight m : for instance, it does not contain Iso ( U ) as a topological subgroup. More generally, every topological subgroup of Iso ( U m ) having density \&lt; m and possessing the bounded orbit property ( {OB} ) is functionally balanced: right uniformly continuous bounded functions are left uniformly continuous.

Using the concentration of measure techniques developed by Gromov and Milman, we prove that the group of automorphisms of a Lebesgue space with a non-atomic measure is extremely amenable with the weak topology but not with the uniform one. Strengthening a de la Harpe's result, we show that a von Neumann algebra is approximately finite-dimensional if and only if its unitary group with the strong topology is the product of an extremely amenable group with a compact group.

It can be computed for many examples; in particular, it is finite for all {UCT} Kirchberg algebras. In fact, all classes of nuclear C ∗ -algebras which have so far been successfully classified consist of examples with finite nuclear dimension, and it turns out that finite nuclear dimension implies many properties relevant for the classification program. Surprisingly, the concept is also linked to coarse geometry, since for a discrete metric space of bounded geometry the nuclear dimension of the associated uniform Roe algebra is dominated by the asymptotic dimension of the underlying space.},

As a consequence of our result and of a theorem of Elliott and Gong, any such C ∗ -algebra, if it additionally satisfies the Universal Coefficients Theorem, is approximately homogeneous of topological dimension at most 3. Our result in particular confirms the Elliott conjecture for the class of simple unital Z -stable {ASH} algebras with real rank zero.

	abstract = {For locally compact groups, Fourier algebras and Fourier–Stieltjes algebras have proven to be useful dual objects. They encode the representation theory of the group via the positive definite functions on the group: positive definite functions correspond to cyclic representations and span these algebras as linear spaces. They encode information about the algebra of the group in the geometry of the Banach space structure, and the group appears as a topological subspace of the maximal ideal space of the algebra. Because groupoids and their representations appear in studying operator algebras, ergodic theory, geometry, and the representation theory of groups, it would be useful to have a duality theory for them. This paper gives a first step toward extending the theory of Fourier–Stieltjes algebras from groups to groupoids. {IfGis} a locally compact (second countable) groupoid, we show that B(G), the linear span of the Borel positive definite functions {onG}, is a Banach algebra when represented as an algebra of completely bounded maps on {aC}*-algebra associated {withG}. This necessarily involves identifying equivalent elements of B(G). An example shows that the linear span of the continuous positive definite functions need not be complete. For groups, B(G) is isometric to the Banach space dual {ofC}*(G). For groupoids, the best analog of that fact is to be found in a representation of B(G) as a Banach space of completely bounded maps from {aC}*-algebra associated {withGto} {aC}*-algebra associated with the equivalence relation induced {byG}. This paper adds weight to the clues in earlier work of M. E. Walter on Fourier–Stieltjes algebras that there is a much more general kind of duality for Banach algebras waiting to be explored.},

A principal result is that if X and Y are two Tichonov spaces whose posets of zero-sets are elementarily equivalent then their respective rings of bounded continuous real-valued functions satisfy the same positive-universal sentences.

As a by-product of the induction used to prove this result, we also obtain a separation result for \${\textbackslash}textbackslashsumˆ1\_1\$ sets: If two \${\textbackslash}textbackslashsumˆ1\_1\$ sets can be separated by a \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashPiˆ}0\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashxi\$ set, they can also be separated by a set which is both \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashDeltaˆ}1\_1\$ and \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashPiˆ}0\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashxi\$. Applications of these results include a study of the effective theory of Borel classes, containing separation and reduction principles, and an effective analog of the Lebesgue-Hausdorff theorem on analytically representable functions. We also give applications to the study of Borel sets and functions with sections of fixed Borel class in product spaces, including a result on the conservation of the Borel class under integration.},

	abstract = {Previous research extending over a few decades has established that multiplicatively large sets (in any of several interpretations) must have substantial additive structure. We investigate here the question of how much multiplicative structure can be found in additively large sets. For example, we show that any translate of a set of finite sums from an infinite sequence must contain all of the initial products from another infinite sequence. And, as a corollary of a result of Renling Jin, we show that if A and B have positive upper Banach density, then A + B contains all of the initial products from an infinite sequence. We also show that if a set has a complement which is not additively piecewise syndetic, then any translate of that set is both additively and multiplicatively large in several senses. We investigate whether a subset of N with bounded gaps—a syndetic set—must contain arbitrarily long geometric progressions. We believe that we establish that this is a significant open question.},

The guide includes information on aspects of the search that are common to all levels, with invaluable tips for those seeking their first or second faculty position. This new edition provides updated advice and addresses hot topics in the competitive job market of today, including the challenges faced by dual-career couples, job search issues for pregnant candidates, and advice on how to deal with gaps in a {CV}. The chapter on alternatives to academic jobs has been expanded, and sample resumes from individuals seeking nonfaculty positions are included. The book begins with an overview of the hiring process and a timetable for applying for academic positions. It then gives detailed information on application materials, interviewing, negotiating job offers, and starting the new job. Guidance throughout is aimed at all candidates, with frequent reference to the specifics of job searches in scientific and technical fields as well as those in the humanities and social sciences. Advice on seeking postdoctoral opportunities is also included. Perhaps the most significant contribution is the inclusion of sample vitas. The Academic Job Search Handbook describes the organization and content of the vita and includes samples from a variety of fields. In addition to {CVs} and research statements, new in this edition are a sample interview itinerary, a teaching portfolio, and a sample offer letter. The job search correspondence section has also been updated, and there is current information on Internet search methods and useful websites.},

In particular, transformation group C*-algebras associated to free minimal Zˆd-actions on the Cantor set with compact space of ergodic measures are classified by their ordered K-theory. In fact, the respective statement holds for finite dimensional compact metrizable spaces, provided that projections of the crossed products separate tracial states. Moreover, C*-algebras associated to certain minimal homeomorphisms of odd spheres are only determined by their spaces of invariant Borel probability measures (without a condition on the space of ergodic measures). Finally, I show that for a large collection of classifiable C*-algebras, crossed products by Zˆd-actions are generically again classifiable.},

In this paper, a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of linear maps δ = \{ δ n , n ∈ N \} on Alg L to be higher derivable at Ω ∈ Alg L is given. Moreover, we show that if there is a faithful projection P in L such that P Ω P and ( I − P ) Ω ( I − P ) are a left or right separating point in P Alg L P and ( I − P ) Alg L ( I − P ) respectively, then a family of linear maps δ = \{ δ n , n ∈ N \} on Alg L is higher derivable at Ω if and only if it is a higher derivation. In particular, if Alg L is an irreducible {CDCSL} algebra or a nest algebra, then a family of linear maps δ = \{ δ n , n ∈ N \} on Alg L is higher derivable at Ω ≠ 0 if and only if it is a higher derivation.},

About twenty years later, Banica and Speicher isolated a class of compact matrix quantum groups with an intrinsic combinatorial structure. These so called easy quantum groups are determined by categories of partitions. They have been proven useful in order to understand various aspects of quantum groups, in particular linked with Voiculescu's free probability theory. Furthermore, they exhibit a way to find examples of compact quantum groups besides q-deformations and quantum isometry groups. These characteristics naturally motivated attempts to fully classify them. This is completed in the present article.},

Using Hjorth's theory of turbulence, the latter two are shown to be not classifiable by countable structures, while the first cannot be reduced to the orbit equivalence relation of any Polish group action. The results for modulo finite rank and modulo compact operators are also shown for the restrictions of these equivalence relations to the space of projection operators. Families of non-classifiable equivalence relations on sequence spaces are described and utilized in these results.},

	abstract = {Complete Pick algebras - these are, roughly, the multiplier algebras in which Pick's interpolation theorem holds true - have been the focus of much research in the last twenty years or so. All (irreducible) complete Pick algebras may be realized concretely as the algebras obtained by restricting multipliers on Drury-Arveson space to a subvariety of the unit ball; to be precise: every irreducible complete Pick algebra has the form \$M\_V = {\textbackslash}textbackslash\{f{\textbackslash}textbar\_V : f {\textbackslash}textbackslashin M\_d{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}\$, where \$M\_d\$ denotes the multiplier algebra of the Drury-Arveson space \$Hˆ2\_d\$, and \$V\$ is the joint zero set of some functions in \$M\_d\$. In recent years several works were devoted to the classification of complete Pick algebras in terms of the complex geometry of the varieties with which they are associated. The purpose of this survey is to give an account of this research in a comprehensive and unified way. We describe the array of tools and methods that were developed for this program, and take the opportunity to clarify, improve, and correct some parts of the literature.},

Then A I is the universal operator algebra for commuting row contractions subject to the relations in I. We ask under which conditions are there topological isomorphisms between two such algebras A I and A J ? We provide a positive answer to a conjecture of Davidson, Ramsey and Shalit: A I and A J are topologically isomorphic if and only if there is an invertible linear map A on C d which maps the vanishing locus of J isometrically onto the vanishing locus of I. Most of the proof is devoted to showing that finite algebraic sums of full Fock spaces over subspaces of C d are closed. This allows us to show that the map A induces a completely bounded isomorphism between A I and A J .},

The domain will be a measurable space (M,ℳ) with a given Markov kernel p(x,dy) on it. Given a measurable map f:M→N, we define a new map Pf:M→N in the following way: for each x∈M, the point Pf(x)∈N is the barycenter of the probability measure p(x,f −1(dy)) on N. The map f is called harmonic on D⊂M if Pf=f on D. Our theory is a nonlinear generalization of the theory of Markov kernels and Markov chains on M. It allows to construct harmonic maps by an explicit nonlinear Markov chain algorithm (which under suitable conditions converges exponentially fast). Many smoothing and contraction properties of the linear Markov operator P M,R carry over to the nonlinear Markov operator P=P M,N . For instance, if the underlying Markov kernel has the strong Lipschitz Feller property then all harmonic maps will be Lipschitz continuous.},

	doi = {10.1007/s11118-004-7740-z},
	abstract = {We present a semigroup approach to harmonic maps between metric spaces. Our basic assumption on the target space (N,d) is that it admits a “barycenter contraction”, i.e. a contracting map which assigns to each probability measure q on N a point b(q) in N. This includes all metric spaces with globally nonpositive curvature in the sense of Alexandrov as well as all metric spaces with globally nonpositive curvature in the sense of Busemann. It also includes all Banach spaces. The analytic input comes from the domain space (M,ρ) where we assume that we are given a Markov semigroup (p t)t{\textbackslash}textgreater0. Typical examples come from elliptic or parabolic second-order operators on Rn, from Lévy type operators, from Laplacians on manifolds or on metric measure spaces and from convolution operators on groups. In contrast to the work of Korevaar and Schoen (1993, 1997), Jost (1994, 1997), Eells and Fuglede (2001) our semigroups are not required to be symmetric. The linear semigroup acting, e.g., on the space of bounded measurable functions u:M→R gives rise to a nonlinear semigroup (P t * )t acting on certain classes of measurable maps f:M → N. We will show that contraction and smoothing properties of the linear semigroup (p t)t can be extended to the nonlinear semigroup (P t * )t, for instance, L p–L q smoothing, hypercontractivity, and exponentially fast convergence to equilibrium. Among others, we state existence and uniqueness of the solution to the Dirichlet problem for harmonic maps between metric spaces. Moreover, for this solution we prove Lipschitz continuity in the interior and Hölder continuity at the boundary. Our approach also yields a new interpretation of curvature assumptions which are usually required to deduce regularity results for the harmonic map flow: lower Ricci curvature bounds on the domain space are equivalent to estimates of the L 1-Wasserstein distance between the distribution of two Brownian motions in terms of the distance of their starting points; nonpositive sectional curvature on the target space is equivalent to the fact that the L 1-Wasserstein distance of two distributions always dominates the distance of their barycenters.},

This means that whenever \$E{\textbackslash}textbackslashsubset F\$ are finite-dimensional \$1\$-exact operator systems, \${\textbackslash}textbackslashphi :E{\textbackslash}textbackslashrightarrow {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{{GS}\}\$ is a unital complete isometry, and \${\textbackslash}textbackslashvarepsilon {\textbackslash}textgreater0\$, there is a linear extension \${\textbackslash}textbackslashwidehat\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashphi \}:F{\textbackslash}textbackslashrightarrow {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{{GS}\}\$ of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashphi \$ such that \${\textbackslash}textbar{\textbackslash}textbar{\textbackslash}textbackslashwidehat\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashphi \}{\textbackslash}textbar{\textbackslash}textbar\_\{cb\}\{\}{\textbackslash}textbar{\textbackslash}textbar{\textbackslash}textbackslashwidehat\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashphi \}ˆ\{-1\}{\textbackslash}textbar{\textbackslash}textbar\_\{cb\}{\textbackslash}textbackslashleq 1+{\textbackslash}textbackslashvarepsilon \$. Such an operator system is unique up to complete order isomorphism. Furthermore it is nuclear, homogeneous, and any separable \$1\$-exact operator system admits a complete order embedding into \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{{GS}\}\$. The space \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{{GS}\}\$ can be regarded as the operator system analog of the Gurarij operator space \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{{NG}\}\$ introduced by Oikhberg, which is in turn a canonical operator space structure on the Gurarij Banach space. We also show that the canonical \${\textbackslash}textbackslashast \$-homomorphism from the universal C*-algebra of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{{GS}\}\$ to the C*-envelope of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{{GS}\}\$ is a \${\textbackslash}textbackslashast \$-isomorphism. This implies that \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{{GS}\}\$ does not admit any complete order embedding into a unital exact C*-algebra. In particular \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{{GS}\}\$ is not completely order isomorphic to a unital C*-algebra. With similar methods we show that the Gurarij operator space \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{{NG}\}\$ does not admit any completely isometric embedding into an exact C*-algebra, and in particular \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{{NG}\}\$ is not completely isometric to a C*-algebra. This answers a question of Timur Oikhberg.},

	abstract = {Continuous first-order logic has found interest among model theorists who wish to extend the classical analysis of “algebraic” structures (such as fields, group, and graphs) to various natural classes of complete metric structures (such as probability algebras, Hilbert spaces, and Banach spaces). With research in continuous first-order logic preoccupied with studying the model theory of this framework, we find a natural question calls for attention. Is there an interesting set of axioms yielding a completeness result? The primary purpose of this article is to show that a certain, interesting set of axioms does indeed yield a completeness result for continuous first-order logic. In particular, we show that in continuous first-order logic a set of formulae is (completely) satisfiable if (and only if) it is consistent. From this result it follows that continuous first-order logic also satisfies an approximated form of strong completeness, whereby Σ⊧φ (if and) only if Σ⊢φ ∸2−n for all n {\textbackslash}textless ω. This approximated form of strong completeness asserts that if Σ⊧φ, then proofs from Σ, being finite, can provide arbitrarily better approximations of the truth of φ. Additionally, we consider a different kind of question traditionally arising in model theory—that of decidability. When is the set of all consequences of a theory (in a countable, recursive language) recursive? Say that a complete theory T is decidable if for every sentence φ, the value φ T is a recursive real, and moreover, uniformly computable from φ. If T is incomplete, we say it is decidable if for every sentence φ the real number φ T o is uniformly recursive from φ, where φ T o is the maximal value of φ consistent with T. As in classical first-order logic, it follows from the completeness theorem of continuous first-order logic that if a complete theory admits a recursive (or even recursively enumerable) axiomatization then it is decidable.},

Define G to be an algebraically determined Polish group if given any Polish group L and an algebraic isomorphism φ : L ↦ G , then φ is a topological isomorphism. The purpose of this paper is to prove a general theorem that gives useful sufficient conditions for a semidirect product of two Polish groups to be algebraically determined. This general theorem will provide a flowchart or recipe for proving that some special semidirect products are algebraically determined. For example, it may be used to prove that the natural semidirect product H ⋊ G , where H is the additive group of a separable Hilbert space and G is a Polish group of unitaries on H acting transitively on the unit sphere with − I ∈ G , is algebraically determined. An example of such a G is the unitary group of a separable irreducible C ⁎ -algebra with identity on H . Not all nontrivial semidirect products of Polish groups are algebraically determined, for it is known that the Heisenberg group H 3 ( R ) is a semidirect product of the form R 2 ⋊ θ R 1 and is not an algebraically determined Polish group.},

We prove stability theorems for the Cuntz semigroup of a commutative C*-algebra which are analogues of classical stability theorems for topological vector bundles over compact Hausdorff spaces. Let {SDG} denote the class of simple, unital, and infinite-dimensional {AH} algebras with slow dimension growth, and let A be an element of {SDG}. We apply our stability theorems to obtain the following: A has strict comparison of positive elements; W(A) is recovered functorially from the Elliott invariant of A; the lower semicontinuous dimension functions on A are weak-* dense in the dimension functions on A; the dimension functions on A form a Choquet simplex. Statement (ii) confirms a conjecture of Perera and the author, while statements (iii) and (iv) confirm, for {SDG}, conjectures of Blackadar and Handelman from the early 1980s.},

	title = {Rokhlin actions of finite groups on {UHF}-absorbing C*-algebras},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7312},
	abstract = {This paper serves as a source of examples of Rokhlin actions or locally representable actions of finite groups on C*-algebras satisfying a certain {UHF}-absorption condition. We show that given any finite group \$G\$ and a separable, unital C*-algebra \$A\$ that absorbs \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}{textbarG}{\textbackslash}textbarˆ{\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty\}\$ tensorially, one can lift any group homomorphism \$G{\textbackslash}textbackslashto{\textbackslash}textbackslashoperatorname\{Aut\}(A)/\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox\_u\}\$ to an honest Rokhlin action \${\textbackslash}textbackslashgamma\$ of \$G\$ on \$A\$. Unitality may be dropped in favour of stable rank one or being stable. If \$A\$ belongs to a certain class of C*-algebras that is classifiable by a suitable invariant (e.g. \$K\$-theory), then in fact every \$G\$-action on the invariant lifts to a Rokhlin action of \$G\$ on \$A\$. For the crossed product C*-algebra \$A{\textbackslash}textbackslashrtimes\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashgamma G\$ of a Rokhlin action on a {UHF}-absorbing C*-algebra, an inductive limit decomposition is obtained in terms of \$A\$ and \${\textbackslash}textbackslashgamma\$. If \$G\$ is assumed to be abelian, then the dual action \${\textbackslash}textbackslashhat\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashgamma\}\$ is locally representable in a very strong sense. We then show how some well-known constructions of finite group actions with certain predescribed properties can be recovered and extended by the main results of this paper, when paired with known classification theorems. Among these is Blackadar's famous construction of symmetries on the {CAR} algebra whose fixed point algebras have non-trivial \$K\_1\$-groups. Lastly, we use the results of this paper to reduce the {UCT} problem for separable, nuclear C*-algebras to a question about certain finite group actions on \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{O\}\_2\$.},

Connes casually remarked that any finite von Neumann algebra ought to be embedded into an ultraproduct of matrix algebras, which is now known as the Connes embedding conjecture or problem. This conjecture became one of the central open problems in the field of operator algebras since E. Kirchberg’s seminal work in 1993 that proves it is equivalent to a variety of other seemingly totally unrelated but important conjectures in the field. Since then, many more equivalents of the conjecture have been found, also in some other branches of mathematics such as noncommutative real algebraic geometry and quantum information theory. In this note, we present a survey of this conjecture with a focus on the algebraic aspects of it.},

	abstract = {In the first part of this work, we studied circle actions with the Rokhlin property on Kirchberg algebras. Here, we define a continuous analog of the Rokhlin property, asking for a continuous path of unitaries instead of a sequence. We show that circle actions with the continuous Rokhlin property on Kirchberg algebras are classified by the \${KK}\$-equivalence class of their fixed point algebra, and in the presence of the {UCT}, by their equivariant \$K\$-theory. We moreover characterize the \$K\$-theoretical invariants that arise in this way. As an important technical result, we show that the continuous Rokhlin property implies the existence of a unital completely positive asymptotic homomorphism from the algebra to its fixed point subalgebra, which is moreover a left inverse for the canonical inclusion. As a consequence, we show that the {UCT} is preserved under formation of crossed products and passage to fixed point algebras by such actions. Using our classification results for Rokhlin actions of the circle, we show that for large classes of unital \$Cˆ*\$-algebras, including all Kirchberg algebras with finitely generated \$K\$-theory, the Rokhlin property is in fact equivalent to the continuous Rokhlin property. We show, by means of an example, that the two notions are not equivalent in general, even on Kirchberg algebras that satisfy the {UCT}.},

	abstract = {We first consider three well-known chain conditions in the space of marked groups: the minimal condition on centralizers, the maximal condition on subgroups, and the maximal condition on normal subgroups. For each condition, we produce a characterization in terms of well-founded descriptive-set-theoretic trees. Using these characterizations, we demonstrate that the sets given by these conditions are co-analytic and not Borel in the space of marked groups. We then adapt our techniques to show elementary amenable marked groups may be characterized by well-founded descriptive-set-theoretic trees, and therefore, elementary amenability is equivalent to a chain condition. Our characterization again implies the set of elementary amenable groups is co-analytic and non-Borel. As corollary, we obtain a new, non-constructive, proof of the existence of finitely generated amenable groups that are not elementary amenable.},

Using equivariant semiprojectivity and partial automorphisms, we show that every circle action with the Rokhlin property is a dual action. We also prove that Kirchberg algebras are preserved under formation of crossed products by such actions. It is shown that the Rokhlin property implies severe \$K\$-theoretical constraints on the algebra it acts on. We explain how circle actions with the Rokhlin property have an \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{Ext\}(K\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashast(Aˆ\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{T\}\}),K\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashast+1\}(Aˆ\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{T\}\}))\$-class naturally associated to them. If \$A\$ is a Kirchberg algebra satisfying the {UCT}, this Ext-class is shown to be a complete invariant for such actions up to conjugacy. More generally, we show that circle actions with the Rokhlin property on Kirchberg algebras are uniquely determined by the \${KK}\$-class of their predual automorphisms.},

	abstract = {In a lecture in Kazan (1977), Goncharov dubbed a number of problems regarding the classification of computable members of various classes of structures. Some of the problems seemed likely to have nice answers, while others did not. At the end of the lecture, Shore asked what would be a convincing negative result. The goal of the present article is to consider some possible answers to Shore's question. We consider structures Д of some computable language, whose universes are computable sets of constants. In measuring complexity, we identify Д with its atomic diagram D(Д), which, via the Gödel numbering, may be treated as a subset of ω. In particular, Д is computable if D(Д) is computable. If K is some class, then Kc denotes the set of computable members of K. A computable characterization for K should separate the computable members of K from other structures, that is, those that either are not in K or are not computable. A computable classification (structure theorem) should describe each member of Kc up to isomorphism, or other equivalence, in terms of relatively simple invariants. A computable non-structure theorem would assert that there is no computable structure theorem. We use three approaches. They all give the “correct” answer for vector spaces over Q, and for linear orderings. Under all of the approaches, both classes have a computable characterization, and there is a computable classification for vector spaces, but not for linear orderings. Finally, we formulate some open problems.},

The recently introduced concept of exponential rank is defined in terms of the number of exponentials required for this purpose. The present paper is concerned with a concept of exponential length, determined not by the number of exponentials but by the sum of the norms of their self-adjoint logarithms. Knowledge of the exponential length of an algebra provides an upper bound for its exponential rank (but not conversely). This is used to estimate the exponential rank of certain algebras of operator-valued continuous functions.},

	abstract = {The concept of real rank of a C∗-algebra is introduced as a non-commutative analogue of dimension. It is shown that real rank zero is equivalent to the previously defined conditions {FS} and {HP}, and that it is invariant under strong Morita equivalence, in particular under stable isomorphism. Real rank zero is also invariant under inductive limits and split extensions, and the class may well be regarded as the conceptual completion of the {AF}-algebras. In some cases, notably when the algebra is matroid, it is shown that the multiplier algebra also has real rank zero—although that is not true in general. By a result of G. J. Murphy, this implies a Weyl-von Neumann type result for self-adjoint multiplier elements in these cases.},

	abstract = {Conditions \$C\$, \$C'\$, and \$C"\$ were introduced for operator spaces in an attempt to study local reflexivity and exactness of operator spaces (Effros and Ruan, 2000). For example, it is known that an operator space \$W\$ is locally reflexive if and only if \$W\$ satisfies condition \$C"\$ (Effros and Ruan, 2000) and an operator space \$V\$ is exact if and only if \$V\$ satisfies condition \$C'\$ (Effros and Ruan, 2000). It is also known that an operator space \$V\$ satisfies condition \$C\$ if and only if it satisfies conditions \$C'\$ and \$C"\$ (Effros and Ruan, 2000, and Han, 2007). In this paper, we define \$p\$-operator space analogues of these definitions, which will be called conditions \$C\_p\$, \$C'\_p\$, and \$C"\_p\$, and show that a \$p\$-operator space on \$L\_p\$ space satisfies condition \$C\_p\$ if and only if it satisfies both conditions \$C'\_p\$ and \$C"\_p\$. The \$p\$-operator space injective tensor product of \$p\$-operator spaces will play a key role.},

	abstract = {This paper is a continuation of the authors' paper [7]; in particular, we give a sharper and more useful criterion for the approximate elementary equivalence of C σ (K) spaces, where K is a totally disconnected compact Hausdorff space. (See Theorem 2 below.) As an application, we obtain a complete description of the Banach spaces X which are approximately equivalent to c 0. Namely, X ≡ A c 0 iff X = C σ (K) where K is a totally disconnected compact Hausdorff space which has a dense set of isolated points and σ is an involutory homeomorphism on K which has a unique fixed point t, and t is not an isolated point. (See Theorem 7.) These results are derived from an analysis which we give of the elementary theories of structures (B, σ), where B is a Boolean algebra and σ is an involutory automorphism of B which leaves at most one nontrivial ultrafilter invariant. Let U(σ) denote this ultrafilter, if it exists; let U(σ) = B in case σ leaves no nontrivial ultrafilter invariant. We show that the elementary theory of (B, σ) is completely determined by the theory of (B, U(σ)) (and conversely, because U(σ) is definable in (B, σ)). This makes possible the use of the explicit invariants given by Éršov [4] for structures (B, U) where U is an ultrafilter on B. (These generalize the Tarski invariants for Boolean algebras [15].) We also use the Éršov invariants in the proof of our main result.},

	abstract = {In this paper we give a closer analysis of the elementary properties of the Banach spaces C(K), where K is a totally disconnected, compact Hausdorff space, in terms of the Boolean algebra B(K) of clopen subsets of K. In particular we sharpen a result in [4] by showing that if B(K 1) and B(K 2) satisfy the same sentences with ≤ n alternations of quantifiers, then the same is true of C(K 1) and C(K 2). As a consequence we show that for each n there exist C(K) spaces which are elementarily equivalent for sentences with ≤ n quantifier alternations, but which are not elementary equivalent in the full sense. Thus the elementary properties of Banach spaces cannot be determined by looking at sentences with a bounded number of quantifier alternations. The notion of elementary equivalence for Banach spaces which is studied here was introduced by the second author [4] and is expressed using the language of positive bounded formulas in a first-order language for Banach spaces. As was shown in [4], two Banach spaces are elementarily equivalent in this sense if and only if they have isometrically isomorphic Banach space ultrapowers (or, equivalently, isometrically isomorphic nonstandard hulls.) We consider Banach spaces over the field of real numbers. If X is such a space, B x will denote the closed unit ball of X, B x = x ϵ X∣ ∣∣x∣∣ ≤ 1. Given a compact Hausdorff space K, we let C(K) denote the Banach space of all continuous real-valued functions on K, under the supremum norm. We will especially be concerned with such spaces when K is a totally disconnected compact Hausdorff space. In that case B(K) will denote the Boolean algebra of all clopen subsets of K. We adopt the standard notation from model theory and Banach space theory.},

We show that, with probability 1, the cpo-completion of this infinite partial order is the universal homogeneous ω-bifinite domain. By alternating the probabilistic one-point extension with completion procedures we obtain almost surely the universal and homogeneous ω-algebraic lattice, ω-Scott domain, and ω-bifinite L-domain, respectively.

As a consequence, we get that the group of isometries of the Urysohn space has unique Polish group topology and the group of isometries of the Urysohn sphere has unique separable group topology. Moreover, as an application of our framework we obtain new proofs of the automatic continuity property for the group \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{Aut\}([0,1],{\textbackslash}textbackslashlambda)\$, due to Ben Yaacov, Berenstein and Melleray and for the unitary group of the infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space, due to Tsankov.

We show that a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbertian {JC} ∗ -triple is completely isometric to one of H ∞ m , R , H ∞ m , L , H ∞ m , R ∩ H ∞ m , L , or the space Φ spanned by creation operators on the full anti-symmetric Fock space. In fact, we show that H ∞ m , L (respectively H ∞ m , R ) is completely isometric to the space of creation (respectively annihilation) operators on the m (respectively m + 1 ) anti-symmetric tensors of the Hilbert space. Together with the finite-dimensional case studied in [M. Neal, B. Russo, Representation of contractively complemented Hilbertian operator spaces on the Fock space, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 134 (2006) 475–485], this gives a full operator space classification of all rank-one {JC} ∗ -triples in terms of creation and annihilation operator spaces. We use the above structural result for Hilbertian {JC} ∗ -triples to show that all contractive projections on a C ∗ -algebra A with infinite-dimensional Hilbertian range are “expansions” (which we define precisely) of normal contractive projections from A * * onto a Hilbertian space which is completely isometric to R, C, R ∩ C , or Φ. This generalizes the well-known result, first proved for B ( H ) by Robertson in [A.G. Robertson, Injective matricial Hilbert spaces, Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 110 (1991) 183–190], that all Hilbertian operator spaces that are completely contractively complemented in a C ∗ -algebra are completely isometric to R or C.

As an application, we give a restatement of the spectral theorem for bimodules in terms of subsets of inverse semigroups. We also show how our viewpoint leads naturally to a description of maximal subdiagonal algebras.},

More surprisingly, Renling Jin showed that whenever A and B have positive upper Banach density, then A − B is piecewise syndetic. Jin’s result follows trivially from the first statement provided that B has large intersection with a shifted copy A − n of A. Of course this will not happen in general if we consider shifts by integers, but the idea can be put to work if we allow “shifts by ultrafilters”. As a consequence we obtain Jin’s Theorem.},

Our main result is that the property of having a positive answer to Kadison’s similarity problem transfers to close C*-algebras. In establishing this result we answer questions about closeness of commutants and tensor products when one algebra satisfies the similarity property. We also examine K-theory and traces of close C*-algebras, showing that sufficiently close algebras have isomorphic Elliott invariants when one algebra has the similarity property.},

In particular, every contractible C*-algebra is an inductive limit of projectives, and one may assume that the connecting morphisms are surjective. Interestingly, an example of Dadarlat shows that trivial shape does not pass to full hereditary sub-C*-algebra. It then follows that the same fails for projectivity. To obtain these results, we develop criteria for inductive limit decompositions, and we discuss the relation with different concepts of approximation. As main application of our findings we show that a C*-algebra is (weakly) projective if and only if it is (weakly) semiprojective and has trivial shape. It follows that a C*-algebra is projective if and only if it is contractible and semiprojective. This confirms a conjecture of Loring.},

We prove a number of general results about this notion, but our main thrust is to situate various mathematically natural classes with respect to the preordering, most notably classes of algebraic structures such as groups and fields.},

In this context, constructions of Ornstein and Weiss are extended by quantitative estimates for the covering properties of the corresponding decompositions. Afterwards, we apply the developed methods to obtain an abstract ergodic theorem for a class of functions mapping subsets of a countable, amenable group into some Banach space. This significantly extends and complements the previous results of Lenz, M{\textbackslash}textbackslash"uller, Schwarzenberger and Veseli{\textbackslash}textbackslash'c. Further, using the Lindenstrauss ergodic theorem, we describe a link of our results to classical ergodic theory. We conclude with two important applications: the uniform approximation of the integrated density of states on amenable Cayley graphs, as well as the almost-sure convergence of cluster densities in an amenable bond percolation model.},

As an application, for a quadratic form Q of signature (2, 1), a lattice Γ in its isometry group, and v 0 ∈ ℝ3 with Q(v 0) {\textbackslash}textgreater 0, we compute the asymptotic (with a logarithmic error term) of the number of points in a discrete orbit v 0Γ of norm at most T, when the stabilizer of v 0 in Γ is finite. Our result in particular implies that for any non-zero integer d, the smoothed count for the number of integral binary quadratic forms with discriminant d 2 and with coefficients bounded by T is asymptotic to c · T log T + O(T).},

After giving an axiomatic definition of tensor products in this category, we examine in detail several particular examples of tensor products, including a minimal, maximal, maximal commuting, maximal injective and some asymmetric tensor products. We characterize these tensor products in terms of their universal properties and give descriptions of their positive cones. We also characterize the corresponding tensor products of operator spaces induced by a certain canonical inclusion of an operator space into an operator system. We examine notions of nuclearity for our tensor products which, on the category of C ⁎ -algebras, reduce to the classical notion. We exhibit an operator system S which is not completely order isomorphic to a C ⁎ -algebra yet has the property that for every C ⁎ -algebra A, the minimal and maximal tensor product of S and A are equal.},

	abstract = {R-trees arise naturally in the study of groups of isometries of hyperbolic space. An R-tree is a uniquely arcwise connected metric space in which each arc is isometric to a subarc of the reals. It follows that an R-tree is locally arcwise connected, contractible, and one-dimensional. Unique and local arcwise connectivity characterize R-trees among metric spaces. A universal R-tree would be of interest in attempting to classify the actions of groups of isometries on R-trees. It is easy to see that there is no universal R-tree. However, we show that there is a universal separable R-tree Tℵ0 . Moreover, for each cardinal α, 3 ≤ α ≤ ℵ0, there is a space \$T\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha {\textbackslash}textbackslashsubset T\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashaleph\_0\}\$ , universal for separable R-trees, whose order of ramification is at most α. We construct a universal smooth dendroid D such that each separable R-tree embeds in D; thus, has a smooth dendroid compactification. For nonseparable R-trees, we show that there is an R-tree Xα, such that each R-tree of order of ramification at most α embeds isometrically into Xα. We also show that each R-tree has a compactification into a smooth arboroid (a nonmetric dendroid). We conclude with several examples that show that the characterization of R-trees among metric spaces, rather than, say, among first countable spaces, is the best that can be expected.},

	abstract = {We present a new distance characterization of Aleksandrov spaces of non-positive curvature. By introducing a quasilinearization for abstract metric spaces we draw an analogy between characterization of Aleksandrov spaces and inner product spaces; the quasi-inner product is defined by means of the quadrilateral cosine—a metric substitute for the angular measure between two directions at different points. Our main result states that a geodesically connected metric space {TeX}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashleft({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{M\},{\textbackslash}textbackslashrho{\textbackslash}textbackslashright)\} is an Aleksandrov {TeX}\{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashRe}\_\{0\}\} domain (also known as a {CAT}(0) space) if and only if the quadrilateral cosine does not exceed one for every two pairs of distinct points in {TeX}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{M\}\} . We also observe that a geodesically connected metric space {TeX}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashleft({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{M\},{\textbackslash}textbackslashrho{\textbackslash}textbackslashright)\} is an {TeX}\{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashRe}\_\{0\}\} domain if and only if, for every quadruple of points in {TeX}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{M\}\} , the quadrilateral inequality (known as Euler’s inequality in {TeX}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{R\}ˆ\{2\}\} ) holds. As a corollary of our main result we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a semimetric space to be an {TeX}\{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashRe}\_\{0\}\} domain. Our results provide a complete solution to the Curvature Problem posed by Gromov in the context of metric spaces of non-positive curvature.},

We characterize groups with non-linear divergence functions as groups having cut-points in their asymptotic cones. That property is weaker than the property of having Morse (rank 1) quasi-geodesics. Using our characterization of Morse quasi-geodesics, we give a new proof of the theorem of Farb-Kaimanovich-Masur that states that mapping class groups cannot contain copies of irreducible lattices in semi-simple Lie groups of higher ranks. It also gives a generalization of the result of Birman-Lubotzky-{McCarthy} about solvable subgroups of mapping class groups not covered by the Tits alternative of Ivanov and {McCarthy}.},

	abstract = {These are notes to accompany four lectures that I gave at the School on Additive Combinatorics, held in Montreal, Quebec between March 30th and April 5th 2006. My aim is to introduce “quadratic fourier analysis” in so far as we understand it at the present time. Specifically, we will describe “quadratic objects” of various types and their relation to additive structures, particularly four-term arithmetic progressions. I will focus on qualitative results, referring the reader to the literature for the many interesting quantitative questions in this theory. Thus these lectures have a distinctly “soft” flavour in many places. Some of the notes cover unpublished work which is joint with Terence Tao. This will be published more formally at some future juncture.},

The Hamiltonian is determined by a choice of graph that specifies the geometry in which the particles move and interact. We prove that approximating the ground energy of the Bose-Hubbard model on a graph at fixed particle number is {QMA}-complete. In our {QMA}-hardness proof, we encode the history of an n-qubit computation in the subspace with at most one particle per site (i.e., hard-core bosons). This feature, along with the well-known mapping between hard-core bosons and spin systems, lets us prove a related result for a class of 2-local Hamiltonians defined by graphs that generalizes the {XY} model. By avoiding the use of perturbation theory in our analysis, we circumvent the need to multiply terms in the Hamiltonian by large coefficients.},

A generalised Kadison's transitivity theorem is established for finite sums of pairwise orthogonal compact tripotents in {JBW} ∗ -triples. We introduce the notion of positively open tripotent in the bidual of a {JB} ∗ -triple as an extension of a concept which was already considered in the setting of ternary rings of operators. We investigate the connections appearing between positively open tripotents and hereditary inner ideals.},

This provides a noncommutative generalization of the Frobenius theorems that describe the asymptotic behavior of the sequence of powers of a stochastic n x n matrix. In cases where M is a von Neumann algebra, the asymptotic lift is shown to be a W*-dynamical system (N,{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb Z), whick we identify as the tail flow of the minimal dilation of L. We are also able to identify the Poisson boundary of L as the fixed point algebra of (N,{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb Z).

	abstract = {Let k be the reproducing kernel for a Hilbert space H(k) of analytic functions on Bd, the open unit ball in Cd, d⩾1. k is called a complete {NP} kernel if k0≡1 and if 1−1/kλ(z) is positive definite on Bd×Bd. Let D be a separable Hilbert space, and consider H(k)⊗D≅H(k,D), and think of it as a space of D-valued H(k)-functions. A theorem of {McCullough} and Trent (J. Funct. Anal.178 (2000), 226–249) partially extends the Beurling–Lax–Halmos theorem for the invariant subspaces of the Hardy space H2(D). They show that if k is a complete {NP} kernel and if D is a separable Hilbert space, then for any scalar multiplier invariant subspace M of H(k,D) there exists an auxiliary Hilbert space E and a multiplication operator φ: H(k,E)→H(k,D) such that φ is a partial isometry and M=φH(k,E). Such multiplication operators are called inner multiplication operators and they satisfy φφ;*=the orthogonal projection onto M. In this paper, we shall show that for many interesting complete {NP} kernels the analogy with the Beurling–Lax–Halmos theorem can be strengthened. We show that for almost every z∈∂Bd the nontangential limit φ(z) of the multiplier φ:Bd→B(E,D) associated with an inner multiplication operator φ is a partial isometry and that rank φ(z) is equal to a constant almost everywhere. The result applies to certain weighted Dirichlet spaces and to the space H2d, which is determined by the kernel kλ(z)=11−〈z,λ〉d ,λ,z∈Bd. In particular, our result implies that the curvature invariant of Arveson (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. {USA}96 (1999), 11,096–11,099) of a pure contractive Hilbert module of finite rank is an integer. This answers a question of W. Arveson (Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. {USA}96 (1999), 11096–11099).},

When the Hardy space is replaced by the Hilbert space H(k) determined by a Nevanlinna–Pick kernel k, such as the Dirichlet kernel or the row contraction kernel on the ball in Cd, the {BLH} Theorem survives with F an auxiliary Hilbert space and Φ a L(F, E) valued function which is inner in the sense that the operator {MΦ} of multiplication by Φ is a partial isometry. Under mild additional hypotheses, when E=C, Mz, the operator of multiplication by z, is cellularly indecomposable and has the codimension one property; however, if M is invariant for Mz, M⊖{MzM} need not be a cyclic subspace for Mz restricted to M.},

Among these notions are thick sets, central sets, piecewise syndetic sets, {IP} sets, and Δ{\textbackslash}{textbackslashDelta} sets. Two related notions, namely {CC} sets and {JJ} sets, arose in the study of combinatorial applications of the algebra of βS{\textbackslash}textbackslashbeta S. If the semigroup is noncommutative, then all of these notions have both left and right versions. In any semigroup, a left thick set must be a right {JJ} set (and of course a right thick set must be a left {JJ} set). We show here that for any free semigroup or free group on more than one generator, there is a set which satisfies all of the left versions of these notions and none of the right versions except {JJ}. We also show that for the free semigroup on countably many generators, there is a left {JJ} set which is not a right {JJ} set.},

These representations are supposed to preserve as much as possible any trace of Booleanness present in the semilattice of idempotents of S{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{S\} . After observing that the Vagner–Preston representation is not tight, we exhibit a canonical tight representation for any inverse semigroup with zero, called the regular tight representation. We then tackle the question as to whether this representation is faithful, but it turns out that the answer is often negative. The lack of faithfulness is however completely understood as long as we restrict to continuous inverse semigroups, a class generalizing the E *-unitaries.},

We study the connections between a triangular substochastic matrix A, whose nth column consists of the elements ai,n, i = 1,…, n, and the Banach space ai,n, En ⊂ En + 1, En ≅ l∞n, where A determines the embeddings of the En. The class of these Banach spaces is the class of all separable Lindenstrauss spaces. Sufficient and necessary conditions are stated for a matrix A to represent c0and c. Furthermore, we characterize the class of all extreme triangular substochastic matrices which represents C(K), where K is the Cantor set. We investigate how the special biface structure of the dual unit ball of X is reflected in the elements of a matrix A representing the separable Lindenstrauss space X. This is applicable to Gurarij spaces; we give a new proof for the maximality property of Gurarij spaces and show that they are isomorphic to A(S) where S is a Choquet simplex with dense extreme points.},

For the property of being a shift of a set of measurable recurrence we show that this is possible when the group does not have cocompact von Neumann kernel. For the stronger property of being piecewise-syndetic we show that this is always possible. For minimally almost periodic, locally compact, second countable, amenable groups, we prove that any dilation of a positive density set by an open neighborhood of the identity contains a set of measurable recurrence, and that the same result holds, up to a shift, when the von Neumann kernel is cocompact. This leads to a trichotomy for locally compact, second countable, amenable groups based on combinatorial properties of large sets. We also prove, using a two-sided Furstenberg correspondence principle, that any two-sided dilation of a positive density set contains a two-sided finite products set.},

It arises as a natural question in quantum computing and quantum physics. "Non-identity-check" is the following decision problem: Given a classical description of a quantum circuit (a sequence of elementary gates), determine whether it is almost equivalent to the identity. Explicitly, the task is to decide whether the corresponding unitary is close to a complex multiple of the identity matrix with respect to the operator norm. We show that this problem is {QMA}-complete. A generalization of this problem is "non-equivalence check": given two descriptions of quantum circuits and a description of a common invariant subspace, decide whether the restrictions of the circuits to this subspace almost coincide. We show that non-equivalence check is also in {QMA} and hence {QMA}-complete.},

	abstract = {We initiate the study of absorbing representations of \$Cˆ{\textbackslash}textbackslashast\$-algebras with respect to closed operator convex cones. We completely determine when such absorbing representations exist, which leads to the question of characterising when a representation is absorbing, as in the classical Weyl-von Neumann type theorem of Voiculescu. In the classical case, this was proven by Elliott and Kucerovsky who proved that a representation is nuclearly absorbing if and only if it induces a purely large extension. By considering a related problem for extensions of \$Cˆ{\textbackslash}textbackslashast\$-algebras, which we call the purely large problem, we ask when a purely largeness condition similar to the one defined by Elliott and Kucerovsky, implies absorption with respect to some given closed operator convex cone. We solve this question for a special type of closed operator convex cone induced by actions of finite topological spaces on \$Cˆ{\textbackslash}textbackslashast\$-algebras. As an application of this result, we give \$K\$-theoretic classification for certain \$Cˆ{\textbackslash}textbackslashast\$-algebras containing a purely infinite, two-sided, closed ideal for which the quotient is an {AF} algebra. This generalises a similar result by the second author, S. Eilers and G. Restorff in which all extensions had to be full.},

	abstract = {We prove an abstract lifting theorem for completely positive maps going out of exact \$Cˆ{\textbackslash}textbackslashast\$-algebras, where we may choose the lift to be weakly in some given closed operator convex cone. Given an action of a space \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf X\$ on our \$Cˆ{\textbackslash}textbackslashast\$-algebras, we apply this theorem, together with an \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf X\$-equivariant selection theorem, to prove that in most cases of interest, we may choose completely positive lifts which are \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf X\$-equivariant. A consequence is, that if \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf X\$ is a second countable topological space, \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathfrak A\$ and \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathfrak B\$ are separable, nuclear \$Cˆ{\textbackslash}textbackslashast\$-algebras over \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf X\$, and the action of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf X\$ on \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathfrak A\$ is continuous (if \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf X\$ is Hausdorff this agrees with \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathfrak A\$ being a continuous \$C\_0({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf X)\$-algebra), then \$E({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf X; {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathfrak A, {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathfrak B) {\textbackslash}textbackslashcong {KK}({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf X; {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathfrak A, {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathfrak B)\$ naturally. Combining this with a deep classification result of Kirchberg, shows that separable, nuclear, stable, strongly purely infinite \$Cˆ{\textbackslash}textbackslashast\$-algebras are strongly classified by ideal related \$E\$-theory. We apply this to prove a classification result using \$K\$-theory, for certain separable, nuclear, strongly purely infinite \$Cˆ{\textbackslash}textbackslashast\$-algebras where no restrictions are made on the primitive ideal spaces of these \$Cˆ{\textbackslash}textbackslashast\$-algebras. Consequently, if \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathfrak A\$ is a separable, nuclear, strongly purely infinite \$Cˆ{\textbackslash}textbackslashast\$-algebra, then \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathfrak A {\textbackslash}textbackslashotimes {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal O\_2 {\textbackslash}textbackslashcong {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathfrak A\$ if and only if every two-sided, closed ideal in \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathfrak A\$ is \${KK}\$-equivalent to zero.},

In this paper we consider the clique problem in graphs, which is {NP}- complete, and try to find its quantum analogue. We show that, quantum clique problem can be defined as follows; Given a quantum channel, decide whether there are k states that are distinguishable, with no error, after passing through channel. This definition comes from reconsidering the clique problem in terms of the zero-error capacity of graphs, and then redefining it in quantum information theory. We prove that, quantum clique problem is {QMA}-complete. In the second part of paper, we consider the same problem for the Holevo capacity. We prove that computing the Holevo capacity as well as the minimum entropy of a quantum channel is {NP}-complete. Also, we show these results hold even if the set of quantum channels is restricted to entanglement breaking ones.},

	abstract = {We prove an operator space version of Maurey’s theorem, which claims that every absolutely (p, 1)-summing map on C(K) is automatically absolutely q-summing for q {\textbackslash}textgreater p. Our results imply in particular that every completely bounded map from B(H) with values in Pisier’s operator space {OH} is completely p-summing for p {\textbackslash}textgreater 2. This fails for p = 2. As applications, we obtain eigenvalue estimates for translation invariant maps defined on the von Neumann algebra V N(G) associated with a discrete group G. We also develop a notion of cotype which is compatible with factorization results on noncommutative L p spaces.},

This result provides many examples of prime von Neumann algebras. These examples of prime von Neumann algebras include prime factors given by Ge (type {II}1) and by Shlyakhtenko (Type {III}).

While {LOCC} emerges as the natural class of operations in many important quantum information tasks, its mathematical structure is complex and difficult to characterize. Here we provide a precise description of {LOCC} and related operational classes in terms of quantum instruments. Our formalism captures both finite round protocols as well as those that utilize an unbounded number of communication rounds. While the set of {LOCC} is not topologically closed, we show that finite round {LOCC} constitutes a compact subset of quantum operations. Additionally we show the existence of an open ball around the completely depolarizing map that consists entirely of {LOCC} implementable maps. Finally, we demonstrate a two-qubit map whose action can be approached arbitrarily close using {LOCC}, but nevertheless cannot be implemented perfectly.},

	abstract = {Correlations in Bell and noncontextuality inequalities can be expressed as a positive linear combination of probabilities of events. Exclusive events can be represented as adjacent vertices of a graph, so correlations can be associated to a subgraph. We show that the maximum value of the correlations for classical, quantum, and more general theories is the independence number, the Lov{\textbackslash}textbackslash'asz number, and the fractional packing number of this subgraph, respectively. We also show that, for any graph, there is always a correlation experiment such that the set of quantum probabilities is exactly the Gr{\textbackslash}textbackslash"otschel-Lov{\textbackslash}textbackslash'asz-Schrijver theta body. This identifies these combinatorial notions as fundamental physical objects and provides a method for singling out experiments with quantum correlations on demand.},

	title = {On zero-error communication via quantum channels in the presence of noiseless feedback},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02987},
	abstract = {We initiate the study of zero-error communication via quantum channels assisted by noiseless feedback link of unlimited quantum capacity, generalizing Shannon's zero-error communication theory with instantaneous feedback. This capacity depends only on the linear span of Kraus operators of the channel, which generalizes the bipartite equivocation graph of a classical channel, and which we dub "non-commutative bipartite graph". We go on to show that the feedback-assisted capacity is non-zero (allowing for a constant amount of activating noiseless communication) if and only if the non-commutative bipartite graph is non-trivial, and give a number of equivalent characterizations. This result involves a far-reaching extension of the "conclusive exclusion" of quantum states [Pusey/Barrett/Rudolph, Nat Phys 8:475, 2012]. We then present an upper bound on the feedback-assisted zero-error capacity, motivated by a conjecture originally made by Shannon and proved by Ahlswede. We demonstrate that this bound is additive and given by a nice minimax formula. We also prove a coding theorem showing that this quantity is the entanglement-assisted capacity against an adversarially chosen channel from the set of all channels with the same Kraus span, which can also be interpreted as the feedback-assisted unambiguous capacity. The proof relies on a generalization of the "Postselection Lemma" (de Finetti reduction) [Christandl/Koenig/Renner, {PRL} 102:020503, 2009] that allows to reflect additional constraints, and which we believe to be of independent interest. This capacity is a relaxation of the feedback-assisted zero-error capacity; however, we do not know whether they coincide in general. We illustrate our ideas with a number of examples, including classical-quantum channels and Weyl diagonal channels, and close with an extensive discussion of open questions.},

This is the problem of detecting when a quantum channel implemented as a circuit is close to a linear isometry, and it is shown to be complete for the complexity class {QMA} of verifiable quantum computation. This is done by relating the problem of detecting when a channel is close to an isometry to the problem of determining how mixed the output of the channel can be when the input is a pure state. How mixed the output of the channel is can be detected by a protocol making use of the swap test: this follows from the fact that an isometry applied twice in parallel does not affect the symmetry of the input state under the swap operation.},

The correspondence between basic colour refinement and fractional isomorphism, due to Tinhofer (1986, 1991) and Ramana, Scheinerman and Ullman (1994), is re-interpreted as the base level of Sherali-Adams and generalised to higher levels in this sense by Atserias and Maneva (2012) and Malkin (2014), who prove that the two resulting hierarchies interleave. In carrying this analysis further, we here give (a) a precise characterisation of the level-k Sherali-Adams relaxation in terms of a modified counting pebble game; (b) a variant of the Sherali-Adams levels that precisely match the k-pebble counting game; (c) a proof that the interleaving between these two hierarchies is strict. We also investigate the variation based on boolean arithmetic instead of real/rational arithmetic and obtain analogous correspondences and separations for plain k-pebble equivalence (without counting). Our results are driven by considerably simplified accounts of the underlying combinatorics and linear algebra.},

We prove that two graphs are isomorphic if and only if their corresponding operator systems are unitally completely order isomorphic. This means that the study of graphs is equivalent to the study of these special operator systems up to the natural notion of isomorphism in their category. We define new graph theory parameters via this identification. Certain quotient norms that arise from studying the operator system of a graph give rise to a new family of parameters of a graph. We then show basic properties about these parameters and write down explicitly how to compute them via a semidefinte program, and discuss their similarities to the Lov{\textbackslash}textbackslash'\{a\}sz theta function. Finally, we explore a particular parameter in this family and establish a sandwich theorem that holds for some graphs.},

	abstract = {We analyse the structure of the quotient \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{A\}\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashsim({\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma},X,{\textbackslash}textbackslashmu)\$ of the space of measure-preserving actions of a countable discrete group by the relation of weak equivalence. This space carries a natural operation of convex combination. We show that the convex structure of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{A\}\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashsim({\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma},X,{\textbackslash}textbackslashmu)\$ is compatible with the topology, and as a consequence deduce that \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{A\}\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashsim({\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma},X,{\textbackslash}textbackslashmu)\$ is path connected. Using ideas of Tucker-Drob we are able to give a complete description of the topological and convex structure of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{A\}\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashsim({\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma},X,{\textbackslash}textbackslashmu)\$ for amenable \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$ by identifying it with the simplex of invariant random subgroups. In particular we conclude that \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{A\}\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashsim({\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma},X,{\textbackslash}textbackslashmu)\$ can be represented as a compact convex subset of a Banach space if and only if \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$ is amenable. We consider the space \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{A\}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashsim\_s\}({\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma},X,{\textbackslash}textbackslashmu)\$ of stable weak equivalence classes and show that is always a compact convex subset of a Banach space. For a free group \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{F\}\_N\$, we show that if one restricts to the compact convex set \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{{FR}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashsim\_s\}({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{F\}\_N,X,{\textbackslash}textbackslashmu) {\textbackslash}textbackslashsubseteq {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{A\}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashsim\_s\}({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{F\}\_N,X,{\textbackslash}textbackslashmu)\$ of the stable weak equivalence classes of free actions, the extreme points are dense in \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{{FR}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashsim\_s\}({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{F\}\_N,X,{\textbackslash}textbackslashmu)\$.},

For this purpose, we incorporate redundancy by mapping a given initial quantum state to a messenger state on a larger dimensional Hilbert space via a C* -algebra embedding. Our noise model for the transmission is a phase damping channel which admits a noiseless subsystem or decoherence-free subspace. More precisely, the transmission channel is obtained from convex combinations of a set of lowest rank yes/no measurements that leave a component of the messenger state unchanged. The objective of our encoding is to distribute quantum information optimally across the noise-susceptible component of the transmission when the noiseless component is not large enough to contain all the quantum information to be transmitted. We derive simple geometric conditions for optimal encoding and construct examples of such encodings.},

The logical depth \$D(G)\$ of a graph \$G\$ is equal to the minimum quantifier depth of a sentence defining \$G\$ up to isomorphism. The logical width \$W(G)\$ is the minimum number of variables occurring in such a sentence. The logical length \$L(G)\$ is the length of a shortest defining sentence. We survey known estimates for these graph parameters and discuss their relations to other topics (such as the efficiency of the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm in isomorphism testing, the evolution of a random graph, quantitative characteristics of the zero-one law, or the contribution of Frank Ramsey to the research on Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem). Also, we trace the behavior of the descriptive complexity of a graph as the logic becomes more restrictive (for example, only definitions with a bounded number of variables or quantifier alternations are allowed) or more expressible (after powering with counting quantifiers).},

They can be characterized as subgroups of metric ultraproducts of families of, respectively, unitary groups U(n) and symmetric groups Sn , n ∈ ℕ. Hyperlinear groups come from theory of operator algebras (Connes' Embedding Problem), while sofic groups, introduced by Gromov, are motivated by a problem of symbolic dynamics (Gottschalk's Surjunctivity Conjecture). Open questions are numerous, in particular it is still unknown if every group is hyperlinear and/or sofic.},

This is used to show that the {setOS} n of alln-dimensional operator spaces equipped with thec.b. version of the Banach Mazur distance is not separable ifn{\textbackslash}textgreater2. As an application we whow that there is more than {oneC} *-norm {onB} (H) ⊗ B (H), or equivalently that {TeXB}(H) {\textbackslash}textbackslashotimes \_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmin \} B(H) {\textbackslash}textbackslashne B(H) {\textbackslash}textbackslashotimes \_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmax \} B(H), which answers a long standing open question. Finally we show that every “maximal” operator space (in the sense of Blecher-Paulsen) is not exact in the infinite dimensional case, and in the finite dimensional case, we give a lower bound for the “exactness constant”. In the final section, we introduce and study a new tensor product {forC} *-albegras and for operator spaces, closely related to the preceding results.},

Thus the class of {exactC} *-algebras is not closed under extensions. The existence comes from a new established tensorial duality between the weak expectation property ({WEP}) of Lance and the local variant ({LLP}) of the lifting property. We characterize the local lifting property of separable {unitalC} *-{algebrasA} as follows:A has the local lifting property if and only if Ext (S(A)) is a group, {whereS}(A) is the suspension {ofA}. If {moreoverA} is the quotient algebra of {aC} *-algebra {withWEP} (for brevity:A {isQWEP}) but does not {satisfyLLP} then there exists a quasidiagonal {extensionB} of the {suspensionS}(A) by the compact operators such that on the algebraic tensor {productB} op ⊙B there is only {oneC} *-norm. The question if {everyC} *-algebra {isQWEP} remains open, but we obtain the following results {onQWEP}: {AC} *-{algebraC} {isQWEP} if and only {ifC} ** {isQWEP}. A von {NeumannII} 1-{factorN} with separable {predualN} * {isQWEP} if and only {ifN} is a von Neumann subfactor of the ultrapower of the {hyperfiniteII} 1-factor. {IfG} is a maximally almost periodic discrete non-amenable group with Haagerup's Herz-Schur multiplier {constantΛ} G =1 then the universal {groupC} *-{algebraC} *(G) is not exact but the reduced {groupC} *-{albegraC} r * (G) is exact and {isQWEP} but does not {satisfyWEP} {andLLP}. We study functiorial properties of the classes {ofC} *-algebras {satisfyingWEP}, {LLP} resp. {beingQWEP}.

We construct on M2 an action of the other structure, which can be considered as the dual action. If the inclusion M0 ⊂M1 is irreducible, we recover quantum groups, as proved in former papers. This construction generalizes the situation which occurs for actions (or co-actions) of groupoı\&amp;\#x0308;ds. Other examples of “quantum groupoı\&amp;\#x0308;ds” are given.},

We also consider a strengthening notion, called extensive isometric embedding, and show that any isometric embedding from a compact ultrametric space into a Polish ultrametric Urysohn space is extensive. It is shown that every isometry between two compact subsets of a Polish ultrametric Urysohn space can be extended to an isometry of the entire space. We introduce a notion of generalized trees to study Polish ultrametric spaces and prove a duality theorem between the categories of Polish ultrametric spaces and their generalized tree representations. Finally we draw some conclusions about the descriptive complexity of embeddability, biembeddability and isometry relations among Polish ultrametric spaces.},

We show first that for every r, there is a real-analytic manifold V r , homogeneous under a transitive action of a compact group G r , which parameterizes E r (ω). The unique G r -invariant probability measure on V r promotes to a probability measure P r,ω on E r (ω), and P r,ω assigns probability 1 to states of rank r. The resulting probability space (E r (ω),P r,ω ) represents “choosing a rank r extension of ω at random”. Main result: For every r = 1, 2, . . . , [rank ω/2], states of (E r (ω),P r,ω ) are almost surely entangled.},

	abstract = {For 0 ⩽ σ \&lt; 1 / 2 we characterize Carleson measures μ for the analytic Besov–Sobolev spaces B 2 σ on the unit ball B n in C n by the discrete tree condition ∑ β ⩾ α [ 2 σ d ( β ) I * μ ( β ) ] 2 ⩽ C I * μ ( α ) \&lt; ∞ , α ∈ T n , on the associated Bergman tree T n . Combined with recent results about interpolating sequences this leads, for this range of σ, to a characterization of universal interpolating sequences for B 2 σ and also for its multiplier algebra. However, the tree condition is not necessary for a measure to be a Carleson measure for the Drury–Arveson Hardy space H n 2 = B 2 1 / 2 . We show that μ is a Carleson measure for B 2 1 / 2 if and only if both the simple condition 2 d ( α ) I * μ ( α ) ⩽ C , α ∈ T n , and the split tree condition ∑ k ⩾ 0 ∑ γ ⩾ α 2 d ( γ ) − k ∑ ( δ , δ ′ ) ∈ G ( k ) ( γ ) I * μ ( δ ) I * μ ( δ ′ ) ⩽ C I * μ ( α ) , α ∈ T n , hold. This gives a sharp estimate for Drury's generalization of von Neumann's operator inequality to the complex ball, and also provides a universal characterization of Carleson measures, up to dimensional constants, for Hilbert spaces with a complete continuous Nevanlinna–Pick kernel function. We give a detailed analysis of the split tree condition for measures supported on embedded two manifolds and we find that in some generic cases the condition simplifies. We also establish a connection between function spaces on embedded two manifolds and Hardy spaces of plane domains.},

Depending on natural assumptions that we make on the states, the eigenvalues of their outputs have new properties which we describe. Our motivation is provided by the additivity questions in quantum information theory, and we build on the idea that a Bell state sent through a product of conjugated random channels has at least one large eigenvalue. We generalize this setting in two directions. First, we investigate general entangled pure inputs and show that Bell states give the least entropy among those inputs in the asymptotic limit. We then study mixed input states, and obtain new multi-scale random matrix models that allow to quantify the difference of the outputs’ eigenvalues between a quantum channel and its complementary version in the case of a non-pure input.},

Comput., 26 (1997), pp. 1277–1339], [Simon, in Proc. 35th Annual {IEEE} Symposium Foundations Comput. Sci., 1994, pp. 116–123, {SIAM} J.

Sci., 1994, pp. 124–134] suggesting that quantum computers are more powerful than classical probabilistic computers. Following Shor's result that factoring and the extraction of discrete logarithms are both solvable in quantum polynomial time, it is natural to ask whether all of \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashNP}\$ can be efficiently solved in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we address this question by proving that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random with probability 1 the class \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashNP}\$ cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine ({QTM}) in time \$o(2ˆ\{n/2\})\$. We also show that relative to a permutation oracle chosen uniformly at random with probability 1 the class \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashNP} {\textbackslash}textbackslashcap {\textbackslash}{textbackslashcoNP}\$ cannot be solved on a {QTM} in time \$o(2ˆ\{n/3\})\$. The former bound is tight since recent work of Grover [in \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashit Proc.{\textbackslash}textbackslash \$28\$th Annual {ACM} Symposium Theory Comput.\}, 1996] shows how to accept the class \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashNP}\$ relative to any oracle on a quantum computer in time \$O(2ˆ\{n/2\})\$.},

We show that they have strong negative type, a condition on every probability distribution of points (with integrable distance to a fixed point). This implies that the function of expected distances to points determines the probability measure uniquely. It also implies that the distance covariance test for stochastic independence, introduced by Székely, Rizzo and Bakirov, is consistent against all alternatives in hyperbolic spaces.

This is the same as proving that the topological group (E*, τ k (E)) is uniformly homeomorphic to a subset of ℓκ2\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashell\_2ˆ{\textbackslash}textbackslashkappa\} for some κ. As an immediate consequence, preduals of commutative von Neumann algebras or duals of commutative C*-algebras are unitarily representable in the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets. The unitary representability of free locally convex spaces (and thus of free Abelian topological groups) on compact spaces, follows as well. The above facts cannot be extended to noncommutative von Neumann algebras or general Schwartz spaces.},

Finite metric spaces that have this property include all spaces on two, three, or four points, all trees, and all finite subspaces of Euclidean spaces. We prove that, if the distance matrix is both hypermetric and regular, then it is of strictly negative type. We show that the strictly negative type finite subspaces of spheres are precisely those which do not contain two pairs of antipodal points. In connection with an open problem raised by Kelly, we conjecture that all finite subspaces of hyperbolic spaces are hypermetric and regular, and hence of strictly negative type.},

	abstract = {A metric space M is homogeneous if every isometry between finite subsets extends to a surjective isometry defined on the whole space. We show that if M is an ultrametric space, it suffices that isometries defined on singletons extend, i.e that the group of isometries of M acts transitively. We derive this fact from a result expressing that the arity of the group of isometries of an ultrametric space is at most 2. An illustration of this result with the notion of spectral homogeneity is given. With this, we show that the Cauchy completion of a homogeneous ultrametric space is homogeneous. We present several constructions of homogeneous ultrametric spaces, particularly the countable homogeneous ultrametric space, universal for rational distances, and its Cauchy completion. From a general embeddability result, we prove that every ultrametric space is embeddable into a homogeneous ultrametric space with the same set of distances values and we also derive three embeddability results due respectively to F. Delon, A. Lemin and V. Lemin, and V. Fevinberg. Looking at ultrametric spaces as 2-structures, we observe that the nerve of an ultrametric space is the tree of its robust modules.},

Specifically, we construct families of translationally-invariant, nearest-neighbour Hamiltonians on a 2D square lattice of \$d\$-level quantum systems (\$d\$ constant), for which determining whether the system is gapped or gapless is an undecidable problem. This is true even with the promise that each Hamiltonian is either gapped or gapless in the strongest sense: it is promised to either have continuous spectrum above the ground state in the thermodynamic limit, or its spectral gap is lower-bounded by a constant in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, this constant can be taken equal to the local interaction strength of the Hamiltonian. This implies that it is logically impossible to say in general whether a quantum many-body model is gapped or gapless. Our results imply that for any consistent, recursive axiomatisation of mathematics, there exist specific Hamiltonians for which the presence or absence of a spectral gap is independent of the axioms. These results have a number of important implications for condensed matter and many-body quantum theory.},

	abstract = {The spectral gap – the difference in energy between the ground state and the first excited state – is one of the most important properties of a quantum many-body system. Quantum phase transitions occur when the spectral gap vanishes and the system becomes critical. Much of physics is concerned with understanding the phase diagrams of quantum systems, and some of the most challenging and long-standing open problems in theoretical physics concern the spectral gap, such as the Haldane conjecture that the Heisenberg chain is gapped for integer spin, proving existence of a gapped topological spin liquid phase, or the Yang-Mills gap conjecture (one of the Millennium Prize problems). These problems are all particular cases of the general spectral gap problem: Given a quantum many-body Hamiltonian, is the system it describes gapped or gapless? Here we show that this problem is undecidable, in the same sense as the Halting Problem was proven to be undecidable by Turing. A consequence of this is that the spectral gap of certain quantum many-body Hamiltonians is not determined by the axioms of mathematics, much as Goedels incompleteness theorem implies that certain theorems are mathematically unprovable. We extend these results to prove undecidability of other low temperature properties, such as correlation functions. The proof hinges on simple quantum many-body models that exhibit highly unusual physics in the thermodynamic limit.},

A maximal vector (for V) is a unit vector ξ ∈ H whose distance to V is maximum d ( ξ , V ) = sup ‖ η ‖ = 1 d ( η , V ) , d ( ξ , V ) denoting the distance from ξ to the set V. Maximal vectors generalize the maximally entangled unit vectors of quantum theory. In general, under a mild regularity hypothesis on V, there is a norm on H whose restriction to the unit sphere achieves its minimum precisely on V and its maximum precisely on the set of maximal vectors. This “entanglement-measuring norm” is unique. There is a corresponding “entanglement-measuring norm” on the predual of B ( H ) that faithfully detects entanglement of normal states. We apply these abstract results to the analysis of entanglement in multipartite tensor products H = H 1 ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ H N , and we calculate both entanglement-measuring norms. In cases for which dim H N is relatively large with respect to the others, we describe the set of maximal vectors in explicit terms and show that it does not depend on the number of factors of the Hilbert space H 1 ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ H N − 1 .},

The first one states that, if \$H\$ is the C*-algebra of a compact quantum group coacting freely on a unital C*-algebra \$A\$, then there is no equivariant \$*\$-homomorphism from \$A\$ to the join C*-algebra \$A*H\$. For \$A\$ being the C*-algebra of continuous functions on a sphere with the antipodal coaction of the C*-algebra of funtions on \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}/2{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}\$, we recover the celebrated Borsuk-Ulam theorem. The second conjecture states that there is no equivariant \$*\$-homomorphism from \$H\$ to the join C*-algebra \$A*H\$. We show how to prove the conjecture in the special case \$A=C({SU}\_q(2))=H\$, which is tantamount to showing the non-trivializability of Pflaum's quantum instanton fibration built from \${SU}\_q(2)\$.},

Brown's convex structure Hom(N,{RˆU}). When A is nuclear, Hom\_w(A,M) is affinely homeomorphic to the trace space of A, but in general Hom\_w(A,M) and the trace space of A do not share the same data (several examples are provided). We characterize extreme points of Hom\_w(A,M) in the case where either A or M is amenable; and we give two different conditions – one necessary and the other sufficient – for extreme points in general. The universality of C*(F\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty) is reflected in the fact that for any unital separable A, Hom\_w(A,M) may be embedded as a face in Hom\_w(C*(F\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty),M). We also extend Brown's construction to apply more generally to Hom(A,{MˆU}).},

If N is not hyperfinite, H om ( N , R ω ) is an infinite-dimensional, complete, metrizable topological space with convex-like structure, and the outer automorphism group Out ( N ) acts on it by “affine” homeomorphisms. (If N ≅ R , then H om ( N , R ω ) is just a point.) Property (T) is reflected in the extreme points – theyʼre discrete in this case. For certain free products N = Σ ⁎ R , every countable group acts nontrivially on H om ( N , R ω ) , and we show the extreme points are not discrete for these examples.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2260},
	abstract = {Let \$G\$ be a countably infinite group, and let \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmu\$ be a generating probability measure on \$G\$. We study the space of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmu\$-stationary Borel probability measures on a topological \$G\$ space, and in particular on \${ZˆG}\$, where \$Z\$ is any perfect Polish space. We also study the space of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmu\$-stationary, measurable \$G\$-actions on a standard, nonatomic probability space. Equip the space of stationary measures with the weak* topology. When \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmu\$ has finite entropy, we show that a generic measure is an essentially free extension of the Poisson boundary of \$(G,{\textbackslash}textbackslashmu)\$. When \$Z\$ is compact, this implies that the simplex of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmu\$-stationary measures on \${ZˆG}\$ is a Poulsen simplex. We show that this is also the case for the simplex of stationary measures on \${\textbackslash}textbackslash\{0,1{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}ˆG\$. We furthermore show that if the action of \$G\$ on its Poisson boundary is essentially free then a generic measure is isomorphic to the Poisson boundary. Next, we consider the space of stationary actions, equipped with a standard topology known as the weak topology. Here we show that when \$G\$ has property (T), the ergodic actions are meager. We also construct a group \$G\$ without property (T) such that the ergodic actions are not dense, for some \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmu\$. Finally, for a weaker topology on the set of actions, which we call the very weak topology, we show that a dynamical property (e.g., ergodicity) is topologically generic if and only if it is generic in the space of measures. There we also show a Glasner-King type 0-1 law stating that every dynamical property is either meager or residual.},

Using this property, we then show that any infinite free product group with the {AP} (approximation property) admits an amenable dynamical system with the following property. There are no proper intermediate C*-algebras between the reduced group C*-algebra and the reduced crossed product. In particular this gives the first example of a minimal ambient nuclear C*-algebra of a non-nuclear C*-algebra. The proof is based on the Powers argument.},

Virtually free groups, such as {SL} 2(ℤ), do not have property (T), and neither do their extensions, such as surface groups. For virtually free groups, we construct stationary actions with arbitrarily small, positive entropy. The construction involves building and lifting spaces of lamplighter groups.

Points satisfying this condition are called generalized Morse sequences. The spectral properties of the shift operator in strictly ergodic systems arising from generalized Morse sequences are investigated. It is shown that under certain broad regularity conditions both the continuous and discrete parts of the spectrum are non-trivial. The eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are calculated. Using the results, given any subgroup of the group of roots of unity, a generalized Morse sequence can be constructed whose continuous spectrum is non-trivial and whose eigenvalue group is precisely the given group. New examples are given for almost periodic points whose orbit closure is not strictly ergodic.},

Recent studies by M.A. Rieffel raise several questions with respect to such a metric on the state space. We propose a relaxation in the way a length function is used in the construction of a metric, and we then show that for groups of rapid decay there are many metrics related to a length function which have all the expected properties. At the end we show that this notion allows a non-commutative version of the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem.},

	abstract = {Alice and Bob receive a bipartite state (possibly entangled) from some finite collection or from some subspace. Alice sends a message to Bob through a noisy quantum channel such that Bob may determine the initial state, with zero chance of error. This framework encompasses, for example, teleportation, dense coding, entanglement assisted quantum channel capacity, and one-way communication complexity of function evaluation. With classical sources and channels, this problem can be analyzed using graph homomorphisms. We show this quantum version can be analyzed using homomorphisms on non-commutative graphs (an operator space generalization of graphs). Previously the Lov{\textbackslash}textbackslash'\{a\}sz \${\textbackslash}textbackslashvartheta\$ number has been generalized to non-commutative graphs; we show this to be a homomorphism monotone, thus providing bounds on quantum source-channel coding. We generalize the Schrijver and Szegedy numbers, and show these to be monotones as well. As an application we construct a quantum channel whose entanglement assisted zero-error one-shot capacity can only be unlocked by using a non-maximally entangled state. These homomorphisms allow definition of a chromatic number for non-commutative graphs. Many open questions are presented regarding the possibility of a more fully developed theory.},

The completely positive rank behaves nicely with respect to direct sums, quotients, ideals and inductive limits. For abelian C∗-algebras it coincides with covering dimension of the spectrum and there are similar results for continuous trace algebras. As it turns out, a C∗-algebra is zero-dimensional precisely if it is {AF}. We consider various examples, particularly of one-dimensional C∗-algebras, like the irrational rotation algebras, the Bunce–Deddens algebras or Blackadar's simple unital projectionless C∗-algebra. Finally, we compare the completely positive rank to other concepts of noncommutative covering dimension, such as stable or real rank.},

If α is an automorphim, Z+ {XαU} can be identified with a subalgebra of the C∗-crossed product Z+ {XαU}. If U is commutative and α is an automorphim satisfying certain conditions, Z+ {XαU} is an operator algebra of the type studied by Arveson and Josephson. Suppose S is a locally compact Hausdorff space, φ: S → S is a continuous and proper map, and α is the endomorphim of U=C0(S) given by α(ƒ) = ƒ ō φ. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the map φ are given to insure that the semi-crossed product Z+{XαC}0(S) is (i) semiprime; (ii) semisimple; (ii) strongly semisimple.},

In contrast, the C⁎-envelope of the familiar contractive semicrossed product A×αZ+ may not equal Cenv⁎(A)×αZ. Our main tool for calculating C⁎-envelopes for semicrossed products is a new concept, the relative semicrossed product of an operator algebra by an endomorphism. As an application of our theory, we show that if {TX}+ is the tensor algebra of a C⁎-correspondence (X,A) and α is a ⁎-extendible automorphism of {TX}+ that fixes the diagonal elementwise, then the contractive semicrossed product satisfies Cenv⁎({TX}+×αZ+)≃{OX}×αZ, where {OX} denotes the Cuntz–Pimsner algebra of (X,A).

Indeed, if ⬚⬚ is a nuclear C * -algebra, then we have 1≤⬚⬚ℒ∞(⬚⬚)≤6, and if ⬚⬚ is a unital nuclear C * -algebra with , we show that ⬚⬚ must be stably finite. We also investigate the connection between the rigid ⬚⬚ℒ∞,1+ structure and the rigid complete order ⬚⬚ℒ∞,1+ structure on C * -algebras, where the latter structure has been studied by Blackadar and Kirchberg in their characterization of strong {NF} C * -algebras.

This extends results of Herer–Christensen, and of Glasner and Furstenberg–Weiss. Proofs of these earlier results used spectral theory or concentration of measure. Our argument is based on a new Ramsey theorem proved using ideas coming from combinatorial applications of algebraic topological methods. Using this work, we give an example of a group which is extremely amenable and contains an increasing sequence of compact subgroups with dense union, but which does not contain a Lévy sequence of compact subgroups with dense union. This answers a question of Pestov. We also show that many Lévy groups have non-Lévy sequences, answering another question of Pestov.},

We survey recent results that exploit this connection to derive large violations of Bell inequalities, study the complexity of the classical and quantum values of games and their relation to Grothendieck inequalities, and quantify the nonlocality of different classes of entangled states.},

	abstract = {We study operator spaces, operator algebras, and operator modules from the point of view of the noncommutative Shilov boundary. In this attempt to utilize some noncommutative Choquet theory, we find that Hilbert C*-modules and their properties, which we studied earlier in the operator space framework, replace certain topological tools. We introduce certain multiplier operator algebras and C*-algebras of an operator space, which generalize the algebras of adjointable operators on a C*-module and the imprimitivity C*-algebra. It also generalizes a classical Banach space notion. This multiplier algebra plays a key role here. As applications of this perspective, we unify and strengthen several theorems characterizing operator algebras and modules. We also include some general notes on the commutative case of some of the topics we discuss, coming in part from joint work with Christian Le Merdy, about function modules.},

In this context, we show that every non-degenerate endomorphism of W is approximately inner and we construct a trace-preserving embedding of W into the central sequences algebra M(W)∞∩W′.

Generalizing partial results of Lindenstrauss and Gutman, we show that free {ZmZm}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb \{Z\}\}ˆm-actions on finite-dimensional spaces satisfy a strengthened version of the so-called marker property, which yields finite Rokhlin dimension for such actions.},

	abstract = {This volume contains the refereed proceedings of the International Conference on Abelian Groups and Modules held at the Dublin Institute of Technology in Ireland, from August 10 until August 14, 1998. The meeting brought together more than 50 researchers and graduate students from 14 countries around the world. In a series of eight invited survey talks, experts in the field presented several active areas of research, including:Â· Almost completely decomposable abelian groups, Butler groups and almost free groups nbsp;â the classification problem, and invariants of special classes of torsion-free abelian groups.Â· Totally projective groups, their automorphism groups and their group rings â questions about unique passage between these categories.Â· Radicals commuting with products.Â· The Ziegler spectra of Neumann regular rings and the class (semi-) groups of {PrÃ}1⁄4fer domains.Â· The Krull-Schmidt property for valuation domains.These main talks were accompanied by many other presentations of current research on abelian groups and modules. Methods from model theory, category theory, infinite combinatorics, representation theory, classical algebra and geometry were applied to the study of abelian groups and modules; conversely, results and methods from abelian group theory were applied to general module theory and non-commutative groups.All this is reflected in the 30 articles in this volume, which introduce the reader to an active and attractive part of algebra that over the years has gained much from its position at the crossroads of mathematics. Lively discussions at the conference influenced the final work on the presented papers, which convey some sense of the intellectual ferment they generated and stimulate the reader to consider and actively investigate the topics and problems contained therein.},

	abstract = {We introduce the concept of Rokhlin dimension for actions of residually finite groups on C*-algebras, extending previous notions of Rokhlin dimension for actions of finite groups and the integers, as introduced by Hirshberg, Winter and the third author. If the group has a box space of finite asymptotic dimension, then actions with finite Rokhlin dimension preserve the property of having finite nuclear dimension, when passing to the crossed product C*-algebra. A detailed study of the asymptotic dimension of box spaces shows that finitely generated, virtually nilpotent groups have box spaces with finite asymptotic dimension, providing a reasonably large class of examples. We then establish a relation between Rokhlin dimension of residually finite groups acting on compact metric spaces and amenability dimension of the action in the sense of Guentner, Willett and Yu. We show that for free actions of infinite, finitely generated, nilpotent groups on finite dimensional spaces, both these dimensional values are finite. In particular, the associated transformation group C*-algebras have finite nuclear dimension. This extends an analogous result about \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}ˆm\$-actions by the first author. We also provide some results concerning the genericity of finite Rokhlin dimension, and permanence properties with respect to the absorption of a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra.},

Generalizing results of both Toms-Winter and Dadarlat-Winter, it is proved that the desirable equivariant analogues of the classical permanence properties hold in this context. For the permanence with regard to equivariant extensions, we need to require a mild extra condition on \${\textbackslash}textbackslashgamma\$, which replaces \$K\_1\$-injectivity assumptions in the classical theory. This condition turns out to be automatic for equivariantly Jiang-Su absorbing C*-dynamical systems, yielding a large class of examples. It is left open whether this condition is redundant for all strongly self-absorbing actions, and we do consider examples that satisfy this condition but are not equivariantly Jiang-Su absorbing.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the quest for an analogue of the Gromov–Hausdorff distance in noncommutative geometry which is well-behaved with respect to C ⁎ -algebraic structures, we propose a complete metric on the class of Leibniz quantum compact metric spaces, named the dual Gromov–Hausdorff propinquity. This metric resolves several important issues raised by recent research in noncommutative metric geometry: it makes *-isomorphism a necessary condition for distance zero, it is well-adapted to Leibniz seminorms, and — very importantly — is complete, unlike the quantum propinquity which we introduced earlier. Thus our new metric provides a natural tool for noncommutative metric geometry, designed to allow for the generalizations of techniques from metric geometry to C*-algebra theory.},

We prove that each non-empty w*-closed face F of A*1, + coincides with the set of elements of A* that attain their norms at a closed projection p in A**, uniquely determined by F. When A is unital, we establish an order anti- isomorphism between the complete lattice of w*-closed faces of A*1, + and the complete lattice of norm-closed inner ideals of A. These results are known for the special case when A is the self-adjoint part of a C*-algebra. The proofs use associative techniques and the Gelfand–Naimark representation. In the general case such techniques are not available, and it is necessary to introduce new techniques including the use of a new inequality of Cauchy–Schwarz type for elements of A*.},

This notion encompasses many prominent examples of countable structures in relational languages, in which the class of algebraically closed substructures is closed under free amalgamation. We show that any free amalgamation theory is {NSOP}4, with weak elimination of imaginaries, and use this to show that several classes of well-known homogeneous structures give new examples of (non-simple) rosy theories without the strict order property. We then prove the equivalence of simplicity and {NTP}2 for free amalgamation theories. As a corollary, we show that any simple free amalgamation theory, with elimination of hyperimaginaries, is 1-based. In the case of modular free amalgamation theories, we also show that simplicity coincides with {NSOP}3. Finally, we consider a special class of Fra{\textbackslash}textbackslash"\{i\}ss{\textbackslash}textbackslash'\{e\} limits, and prove a combinatorial characterization of simplicity, which provides new context for the fact that the generic \$K\_n\$-free graphs are {SOP}3, while the high arity generic \$Kˆr\_n\$-free \$r\$-hypergraphs are simple.},

Finally, Z is said to have the Complete Separable Complementation Property ({CSCP}) if Z is locally reflexive and T admits a completely bounded extension to Y provided Y is locally reflexive and T is a complete surjective isomorphism. Let K denote the space of compact operators on separable Hilbert space and K0 the c0 sum of Mn's (the space of “small compact operators”). It is proved that K has the {CSCP}, using the second author's previous result that K0 has this property. A new proof is given for the result (due to E. Kirchberg) that K0 (and hence K) fails the {CSEP}. It remains an open question if K has the {MSEP}; it is proved this is equivalent to whether K0 has this property. A new Banach space concept, Extendable Local Reflexivity ({ELR}), is introduced to study this problem. Further complements and open problems are discussed.},

	abstract = {We study the local lifting property for operator spaces. This is a natural non-commutative analogue of the Banach space local lifting property, but is very different from the local lifting property studied in C*-algebra theory. We show that an operator space has the λ-local lifting property if and only if it is an {LΓ}1, λ space. These operator space are λ-completely isomorphic to the operator subspaces of the operator preduals of von Neumann algebras, and thus λ-locally reflexive. Moreover, we show that an operator space V has the λ-local lifting property if and only if its operator space dual V* is λ-injective.},

Our central question is whether there exist two-party pseudo-telepathy games which cannot be won with probability one using a maximally entangled state. Towards answering this question, we develop conditions under which maximally entangled states suffice. In particular, we show that maximally entangled states suffice for weak projection games which we introduce as a relaxation of projection games. Our results also imply that any pseudo-telepathy weak projection game yields a device-independent certification of a maximally entangled state. In particular, by establishing connections to the setting of communication complexity, we exhibit a class of games \$G\_n\$ for testing maximally entangled states of local dimension \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}(n)\$. We leave the robustness of these self-tests as an open question.},

Via a polynomial-time Karp reduction, we show that independent set games are the hardest instances of this problem. Secondly, we show that if every independent set game whose entangled value is equal to one admits a perfect entangled strategy, then the same holds for all symmetric synchronous games. Finally, we identify combinatorial lower bounds on the classical and entangled values of synchronous games in terms of variants of the independence number of appropriate graphs. Our results suggest that independent set games might be representative of all nonlocal games when dealing with questions concerning perfect entangled strategies.},

This class goes beyond degradable channels. The estimate are based on a "local comparison theorem" for sandwiched R{\textbackslash}textbackslash'enyi relative entropy and complex interpolation. As an application, we discover new small dimensional examples which admit an easy formula for quantum and private capacities.},

	abstract = {Tsirelson's problem asks whether the commuting operator model for two-party quantum correlations is equivalent to the tensor-product model. We give a negative answer to this question by showing that there are non-local games which have perfect commuting-operator strategies, but do not have perfect tensor-product strategies. The weak Tsirelson problem, which is known to be equivalent to Connes embedding problem, remains open. The examples we construct are instances of (binary) linear system games. For such games, previous results state that the existence of perfect strategies is controlled by the solution group of the linear system. Our main result is that every finitely-presented group embeds in some solution group. As an additional consequence, we show that the problem of determining whether a linear system game has a perfect commuting-operator strategy is undecidable.},

Given some approximations to a cluster of neighboring eigenvalues and to the corresponding eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix, and given an estimate for the gap that separates the cluster from all other eigenvalues, how much can the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors differ from the subspace spanned by our approximations? These questions are closely related; both are investigated here. The difference between the two subspaces is characterized in terms of certain angles through which one subspace must be rotated in order most directly to reach the other. These angles unify the treatment of natural geometric, operator-theoretic and error-analytic questions concerning those subspaces. Sharp bounds upon trigonometric functions of these angles are obtained from the gap and from bounds upon either the perturbation (1st question) or a computable residual (2nd question). An example is included.},

	abstract = {If a matrix pencil A−λB is known only to within a tolerance ϵ (because of measurement or roundoff errors), then it may be difficult to compute a generalized eigendecomposition of A−λB, since its eigenspaces are discontinuous functions of its entries. We are interested in computing an eigendecomposition of A−λB which varies continuously and boundedly as A−λB varies inside a ball of radius ϵ. There are two cases with qualitatively different solutions. The first case is when A−λB is regular, i.e. det(A−λB) is not identically zero. In this case we show how to partition the spectrum of A−λB into disjoint pieces which remain disjoint and whose associated eigenspaces vary smoothly. The second case is when A−λB is singular [i.e. either det(A−λB)≡0 or A−λB is nonsquare]. This case is more difficult than the first, because applications call for computing nongeneric eigenspaces which exist only when A−λB lies in a proper variety (a set of measure zero). The known algorithms for computing these nongeneric structures produce the eigendecomposition of a pencil close to the input which is guaranteed to lie in this proper variety. In this case we prove that as long as the norm of the perturbations produced by the algorithm are smaller than a certain ϵ we can compute from the pencil, the resulting nongeneric eigenspaces and eigenvalues produced by the algorithm vary smoothly. This theorem shows that standard algorithms can compute accurate solutions of many ill-posed problems in systems theory, such as the controllable subspace and uncontrollable modes of a system x̀=Cx+Du.},

This paper supplies analogous results when A is subject to a congruential, or multiplicative, perturbation A→Ã=D*{AD}. The relative gaps that appear in the bounds involve the spectrum of only one matrix, either A or Ã, in contrast to the gaps that appear in the single angle bounds. The double angle theorems do not directly bound the difference between the old invariant subspace S and the new one S̃ but instead bound the difference between S̃ and its reflection {JS}̃ where the mirror is S and J reverses S⊥, the orthogonal complement of S. The double angle bounds are proportional to the departure from the identity and from orthogonality of the matrix D̃={defD}−1JDJ. Note that D̃ is invariant under the transformation D→D/αforα≠0, whereas the single angle theorems give bounds proportional to D's departure from the identity and from orthogonality. The corresponding results for the singular value problem when a (nonsquare) matrix B is perturbed to B̃=D*1BD2 are also presented.},

In part I of this series, two other kinds of relative distances which have much better mathematical properties have been introduced and employed to establish theories. It is shown that these different measurements are topologically equivalent. However, the δ-measure is more convenient to use in practice. In this part, we established relative perturbation bounds directly using the classical measure. The new bounds for diagonalizable matrices are cleaner than the corresponding ones in part I and yield nice bounds for Hermitian matrices, too. But when applied to nonnegative definite Hermitian matrices, the new bounds are weaker than those in part I.},

However, there are situations where even small eigenvalues are determined to high relative accuracy by the data much more accurately than the classical perturbation theory would indicate. In this paper, we study how eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix A change when it is perturbed to \${\textbackslash}textbackslashwtd A=Dˆ*{AD}\$, where D is close to a unitary matrix, and how singular values of a (nonsquare) matrix B change when it is perturbed to \${\textbackslash}textbackslashwtd B=D\_1ˆ*{BD}\_2\$, where D1 and D2 are nearly unitary.

Suppose that \$H\$ is a sofic group and \$G\$ is a countable, discrete group. If \$G\$ is sofic, hyperlinear, weakly sofic, or linear sofic, then \$G{\textbackslash}textbackslashwr H\$ is also sofic, hyperlinear, weakly sofic, or linear sofic respectively. In each case we construct relevant metric approximations, extending a general construction of metric approximations for \$G{\textbackslash}textbackslashwr H\$ that uses soficity of \$H\$.},

In particular we prove, each time for certain (but not necessarily the same) classes \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashC}\$ that: {\textbackslash}textbackslashlinebreak (i) the direct product of two \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashC}\$-approximable groups is \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashC}\$-approximable; (ii) the restricted standard wreath product \$G {\textbackslash}textbackslashwr H\$ is \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashC}\$-approximable when \$G\$ is \$\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal C\}\$-approximable and \$H\$ is residually finite; and (iii) a group \$G\$ with normal subgroup \$N\$ is \$\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal C\}\$-approximable when \$N\$ is \$\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal C\}\$-approximable and \$G/N\$ is amenable. Our direct product result is valid for {LEF}, weakly sofic and hyperlinear groups, as well as for all groups that are approximable by finite groups equipped with commutator-contractive invariant length functions (considered by Thom). Our wreath product result is valid for weakly sofic groups, and we prove it separately for sofic groups. Our result on extensions by amenable groups is valid for weakly sofic groups, and was proved by Elek and Szabo for sofic groups \$N\$.},

	title = {Crossed products by compact group actions with the Rokhlin property},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1946},
	abstract = {We present a systematic study of the structure of crossed products and fixed point algebras by compact group actions with the Rokhlin property on not necessarily unital C*-algebras. Our main technical result is the existence of an approximate homomorphism from the algebra to its subalgebra of fixed points, which is a left inverse for the canonical inclusion. Upon combining this with results regarding local approximations, we show that a number of classes characterized by inductive limit decompositions with weakly semiprojective building blocks, are closed under formation of crossed products by such actions. Similarly, in the presence of the Rokhlin property, if the algebra has any of the following properties, then so do the crossed product and the fixed point algebra: being a Kirchberg algebra, being simple and having tracial rank zero or one, having real rank zero, having stable rank one, absorbing a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra, satisfying the Universal Coefficient Theorem (in the simple, nuclear case), and being weakly semiprojective. The ideal structure of crossed products and fixed point algebras by Rokhlin actions is also studied. The methods of this paper unify, under a single conceptual approach, the work of a number of authors, who used rather different techniques. Our methods yield new results even in the well-studied case of finite group actions with the Rokhlin property.},

	abstract = {Using Popa's deformation/rigidity theory, we investigate prime decompositions of von Neumann algebras of the form \$L({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\})\$ for countable probability measure preserving equivalence relations \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\}\$. We show that \$L({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\})\$ is prime whenever \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\}\$ is nonamenable, ergodic, and admits an unbounded 1-cocycle into a mixing orthogonal representation weakly contained in the regular representation. This is accomplished by constructing the \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtextit\{Gaussian extension \}{\textbackslash}textbackslashtilde\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\}\}\$ of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\}\$ and subsequently an s-malleable deformation of the inclusion \$L({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\}) {\textbackslash}textbackslashsubset L({\textbackslash}textbackslashtilde\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\}\})\$. We go on to note a general obstruction to unique prime factorization, and avoiding it, we prove a unique prime factorization result for products of the form \$L({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\}\_1) {\textbackslash}textbackslashotimes L({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\}\_2) {\textbackslash}textbackslashotimes {\textbackslash}textbackslashcdots {\textbackslash}textbackslashotimes L({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\}\_k)\$.

For pre-ordered Banach spaces \$X\$ and \$Y\$ with closed cones we investigate normality of \$B(X,Y)\$ in terms of normality and conormality of the underlying spaces \$X\$ and \$Y\$. Furthermore, we define a class of ordered Banach spaces called quasi-lattices which strictly contains the Banach lattices, and we prove that every strictly convex reflexive ordered Banach space with a closed proper generating cone is a quasi-lattice. These spaces provide a large class of examples \$X\$ and \$Y\$ that are not Banach lattices, but for which \$B(X,Y)\$ is normal. In particular, we show that a Hilbert space \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{H\}\$ endowed with a Lorentz cone is a quasi-lattice (that is not a Banach lattice if \${\textbackslash}textbackslashdim{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{H\}{\textbackslash}textbackslashgeq3\$), and satisfies an identity analogous to the elementary Banach lattice identity \${\textbackslash}textbackslash{\textbackslash}textbar{\textbackslash}textbarx{\textbackslash}textbar{\textbackslash}textbackslash{\textbackslash}textbar={\textbackslash}textbackslash{\textbackslash}textbarx{\textbackslash}textbackslash{\textbackslash}textbar\$ which holds for all elements \$x\$ of a Banach lattice. This is used to show that spaces of operators between such ordered Hilbert spaces are always absolutely monotone and that the operator norm is positively attained, as is also always the case for spaces of operators between Banach lattices.},

	abstract = {The Lovasz Local Lemma ({LLL}) is a powerful tool in probability theory to show the existence of combinatorial objects meeting a prescribed collection of "weakly dependent" criteria. We show that the {LLL} extends to a much more general geometric setting, where events are replaced with subspaces and probability is replaced with relative dimension, which allows to lower bound the dimension of the intersection of vector spaces under certain independence conditions. Our result immediately applies to the k-{QSAT} problem: For instance we show that any collection of rank 1 projectors with the property that each qubit appears in at most \$2ˆk/(e {\textbackslash}textbackslashcdot k)\$ of them, has a joint satisfiable state. We then apply our results to the recently studied model of random k-{QSAT}. Recent works have shown that the satisfiable region extends up to a density of 1 in the large k limit, where the density is the ratio of projectors to qubits. Using a hybrid approach building on work by Laumann et al. we greatly extend the known satisfiable region for random k-{QSAT} to a density of \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}(2ˆk/kˆ2)\$. Since our tool allows us to show the existence of joint satisfying states without the need to construct them, we are able to penetrate into regions where the satisfying states are conjectured to be entangled, avoiding the need to construct them, which has limited previous approaches to product states.},

So, the numerical range of the elements of our contractive approximate identity is contained in the closed disk center 12 and radius 12. This is the necessarily weakened form of the result for C⁎-algebras, where there is always a contractive approximate identity consisting of operators with 0⩽T⩽1 – the numerical range is contained in the real interval [0,1]. So, if an operator algebra has a c.a.i., it must have operators with a “certain amount” of positivity.},

Our first result is the existence of an efficient universal quantum Turing machine in Deutsch's model of a quantum Turing machine ({QTM}) [Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A, 400 (1985), pp. 97–117]. This construction is substantially more complicated than the corresponding construction for classical Turing machines ({TMs}); in fact, even simple primitives such as looping, branching, and composition are not straightforward in the context of quantum Turing machines. We establish how these familiar primitives can be implemented and introduce some new, purely quantum mechanical primitives, such as changing the computational basis and carrying out an arbitrary unitary transformation of polynomially bounded dimension.We also consider the precision to which the transition amplitudes of a quantum Turing machine need to be specified. We prove that \$O({\textbackslash}textbackslashlog T)\$ bits of precision suffice to support a T step computation. This justifies the claim that the quantum Turing machine model should be regarded as a discrete model of computation and not an analog one. We give the first formal evidence that quantum Turing machines violate the modern (complexity theoretic) formulation of the Church–Turing thesis. We show the existence of a problem, relative to an oracle, that can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum Turing machine, but requires superpolynomial time on a bounded-error probabilistic Turing machine, and thus not in the class \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashBPP}\$. The class \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashBQP}\$ of languages that are efficiently decidable (with small error-probability) on a quantum Turing machine satisfies \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashBPP} {\textbackslash}textbackslashsubseteq {\textbackslash}{textbackslashBQP} {\textbackslash}textbackslashsubseteq {\textbackslash}{textbackslashPtimeˆ}\{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashSP}\}\$. Therefore, there is no possibility of giving a mathematical proof that quantum Turing machines are more powerful than classical probabilistic Turing machines (in the unrelativized setting) unless there is a major breakthrough in complexity theory.},

We prove existence of conditional expectations onto tail algebras in various settings and we define a natural C*-subalgebra of the tail algebra, called the tail C*-algebra. Extending and building on the proof of the noncommutative de Finetti theorem of Koestler and Speicher, we prove a de Finetti type theorem that characterizes quantum symmetric states in terms of amalgamated free products over the tail C*-algebra, and we provide a convenient description of the set of all quantum symmetric states on the free product C*-algebra in terms of C*-algebras generated by homomorphic images of A and the tail C*-algebra. This description allows a characterization of the extreme quantum symmetric states. Similar results are proved for the subset of tracial quantum symmetric states, though in terms of von Neumann algebras and normal conditional expectations. The central quantum symmetric states are those for which the tail algebra is in the center of the von Neumann algebra, and we show that the central quantum symmetric states form a Choquet simplex whose extreme points are the free product states, while the tracial central quantum symmetric states form a Choquet simplex whose extreme points are the free product traces.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03132},
	abstract = {The density of a code is the fraction of the coding space covered by packing balls centered around the codewords. This paper investigates the density of codes in the complex Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds equipped with their commonly used chordal distance. The choice of distance enforces the treatment of the manifolds as subspaces of Euclidean hyperspheres. In this geometry, the densest packings are not necessarily equivalent to the maximum-minimum-distance codes. Computing a code's density follows from computing i) the normalized volume of a metric ball and ii) the kissing radius, the radius of the largest balls one can pack around the codewords without overlapping. First, the normalized volume of a metric ball is evaluated by asymptotic approximations. For a small ball, its volume can be well-approximated by the volume of a locally-equivalent tangential ball. In order to properly normalize this approximation, the precise volumes of the manifolds induced by their spherical embedding are computed. For larger balls, a hyperspherical cap approximation is used, which is justified by a volume comparison theorem showing that the normalized volume of a ball in the Stiefel or Grassmann manifold is asymptotically equal to the normalized volume of a ball in its embedding sphere as the dimension grows to infinity. Then, bounds on the kissing radius are derived alongside corresponding bounds on the density. Unlike for spherical codes or for codes in flat spaces, the kissing radius of a Grassmann or Stiefel code cannot be exactly determined from its minimum distance. It is nonetheless possible to derive bounds on density as functions of the minimum distance. Stiefel and Grassmann codes have larger density than their image spherical codes when dimensions tend to infinity. The bounds on density lead to refinements of the standard Hamming bounds for Stiefel and Grassmann codes.},

We suggest two procedures to estimate the correction factors. Comparing with the ordinary kernel density estimator, for small smoothing parameter matrix and/or for large sample size n, the suggested semiparametric density estimator is seen to have approximately the same variance to the order of approximation used but a smaller bias. A one-to-one transformation of Pk,m−k into Rk(m−k) is of use in the asymptotic investigation. The general discussion is applied and examined for special kernel function, discrepancy measures for matrices on Pk,m−k and starting parametric model.},

As an application of quantum variance, new measures of random and inherent quantum noise are introduced for measurements of quantum systems, modifying some recent ideas of Polterovich.},

	abstract = {Josza's definition of fidelity for a pair of (mixed) quantum states is studied in the context of two types of operator algebras. The first setting is mainly algebraic in that it involves unital C\$ˆ*\$-algebras \$A\$ that possess a faithful trace functional \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtau\$. In this context, the role of quantum states (that is, density operators) in the classical quantum-mechanical framework is assumed by positive elements \${\textbackslash}textbackslashrho{\textbackslash}textbackslashin A\$ for which \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtau({\textbackslash}textbackslashrho)=1\$. The second of our two settings is more operator theoretic: by fixing a faithful normal semifinite trace \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtau\$ on a semifinite von Neumann algebra \$M\$, we define and consider the fidelity of pairs of positive operators in \$M\$ of unit trace. The main results of this paper address monotonicity and preservation of fidelity under the action of certain trace-preserving positive linear maps of \$A\$ or of the predual \$M\_*\$. Our results also yield a new proof of a theorem of Moln{\textbackslash}textbackslash'ar on the structure of quantum channels on the trace-class operators that preserve fidelity.},

We show that the semidirect product group \$G=H{\textbackslash}textbackslashrtimes\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashpi\}{\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$ is {SIN} (\$G\$ admits a two-sided invariant metric compatible with its topology) and unitarily representable (\$G\$ embeds into the unitary group \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{U\}({\textbackslash}textbackslashellˆ2({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb N))\$), if and only if \${\textbackslash}textbackslashpi\$ is uniformly bounded, and that \${\textbackslash}textbackslashpi\$ is unitarizable if and only if \$G\$ is of finite type: that is, \$G\$ embeds into the unitary group of a {II}\$\_1\$-factor. Consequently, we show that a unitarily representable Polish {SIN} groups need not be of finite type, answering a question of Sorin Popa.

	doi = {10.1007/978-3-319-40970-2_15},
	abstract = {The boolean Pythagorean Triples problem has been a longstanding open problem in Ramsey Theory: Can the set N = \${\textbackslash}textbackslash\{1, 2, ...{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}\$ of natural numbers be divided into two parts, such that no part contains a triple \$(a,b,c)\$ with \$aˆ2 + bˆ2 = cˆ2\$ ? A prize for the solution was offered by Ronald Graham over two decades ago. We solve this problem, proving in fact the impossibility, by using the Cube-and-Conquer paradigm, a hybrid {SAT} method for hard problems, employing both look-ahead and {CDCL} solvers. An important role is played by dedicated look-ahead heuristics, which indeed allowed to solve the problem on a cluster with 800 cores in about 2 days. Due to the general interest in this mathematical problem, our result requires a formal proof. Exploiting recent progress in unsatisfiability proofs of {SAT} solvers, we produced and verified a proof in the {DRAT} format, which is almost 200 terabytes in size. From this we extracted and made available a compressed certificate of 68 gigabytes, that allows anyone to reconstruct the {DRAT} proof for checking.},

	abstract = {We study topological properties of conjugacy classes in Polish groups, with emphasis on automorphism groups of homogeneous countable structures. We first consider the existence of dense conjugacy classes (the topological Rokhlin property). We then characterize when an automorphism group admits a comeager conjugacy class (answering a question of Truss) and apply this to show that the homeomorphism group of the Cantor space has a comeager conjugacy class (answering a question of Akin, Hurley and Kennedy). Finally, we study Polish groups that admit comeager conjugacy classes in any dimension (in which case the groups are said to admit ample generics). We show that Polish groups with ample generics have the small index property (generalizing results of Hodges, Hodkinson, Lascar and Shelah) and arbitrary homomorphisms from such groups into separable groups are automatically continuous. Moreover, in the case of oligomorphic permutation groups, they have uncountable cofinality and the Bergman property. These results in particular apply to automorphism groups of many ω-stable, ℵ0-categorical structures and of the random graph. In this connection, we also show that the infinite symmetric group S∞ has a unique non-trivial separable group topology. For several interesting groups we also establish Serre's properties ({FH}) and ({FA}).},

	doi = {10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577892},
	abstract = {This paper considers the quantization problem on the Grassmann manifold with dimension n and p. The unique contribution is the derivation of a closed-form formula for the volume of a metric ball in the Grassmann manifold when the radius is sufficiently small. This volume formula holds for Grassmann manifolds with arbitrary dimension n and p, while previous results are only valid for either p = 1 or a fixed p with asymptotically large n. Based on the volume formula, the Gilbert-Varshamov and Hamming bounds for sphere packings are obtained. Assuming a uniformly distributed source and a distortion metric based on the squared chordal distance, tight lower and upper bounds are established for the distortion rate tradeoff. Simulation results match the derived results. As an application of the derived quantization bounds, the information rate of a multiple-input multiple-output ({MIMO}) system with finite-rate channel-state feedback is accurately quantified for arbitrary finite number of antennas, while previous results are only valid for either multiple-input single-output ({MISO}) systems or those with asymptotically large number of transmit antennas but fixed number of receive antennas.},

Let X1,…, Xn be a random sample of size n from the matrix Langevin (or von Mises-Fisher) distribution on Vk,m, which has the density proportional to exp(tr F′X), with F an m × k matrix, and let Z = (mn)12 Σj = 1n Xj. The exact expression of the distribution of Z in an integral form is intractable. In this paper, we derive asymptotic expansions, for large n and up to the order of n−3, for the distributions of Z, Z′Z, and related statistics in connection with testing problems on F, under the hypothesis of uniformity (F = 0) and local alternative hypotheses. In the derivation, we utilize zonal and invariant polynomials in matrix arguments and Hermite and Laguerre polynomials in one-dimensional variable and matrix argument.},

	abstract = {Volume of metric balls relates to rate-distortion theory and packing bounds on codes. In this paper, the volume of balls in complex Grassmann manifolds is evaluated for an arbitrary radius. The ball is defined as a set of hyperplanes of a fixed dimension with reference to a center of possibly different dimension, and a generalized chordal distance for unequal dimensional subspaces is used. First, the volume is reduced to one-dimensional integral representation. The overall problem boils down to evaluating a determinant of a matrix of the same size as the subspace dimensionality. Interpreting this determinant as a characteristic function of the Jacobi ensemble, an asymptotic analysis is carried out. The obtained asymptotic volume is moreover refined using moment-matching techniques to provide a tighter approximation in finite-size regimes. Lastly, the pertinence of the derived results is shown by rate-distortion analysis of source coding on Grassmann manifolds.},

It is proved to also preserve complete quotient maps, and to be self-dual in the sense that it induces the Haagerup norm on the algebraic tensor product V∗ ⊗ W∗. The full operator dual space (V ⊗h W)∗ is computed. It coincides with the natural operator space {\textbackslash}textbackslash̃{gG}2(V, W∗) of maps ϑ: V → W∗ which have completely bounded factorizations through Hilbert spaces (with vectors identified with row matrices). More generally, one has the natural complete isometry {\textbackslash}textbackslash̃{gG}2(V ⊗h W, X) ≊ {\textbackslash}textbackslash̃{gG}2(V, {\textbackslash}textbackslash̃{gG}2(W, X)). Given Hilbert spaces H and K with vectors regarded as column matrices, it is shown that one may identify the operator spaces B(H, K) and {CB}(H, K).},

These two structures of quantum groupoı\&amp;\#x0308;ds, dual to each other, can be placed on the relative commutants M′0∩M2 and M′1∩M3 in such a way that the canonical Jones' tower associated to the inclusion can be described as a tower of successive crossed-products by these two structures.},

	abstract = {We show that Lance's weak expectation property is connected to tight Riesz interpolations in lattice theory. More precisely we first prove that if A {\textbackslash}textbackslashsubset B(H) is a unital C*-subalgebra, where B(H) is the bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space H, then A has (2,2) tight Riesz interpolation property in B(H) (defined below). An extension of this requires an additional assumption on A: A has (2,3) tight Riesz interpolation property in B(H) at every matricial level if and only if A has the weak expectation property. Let \$J = span\{(1,1,-1,-1,-1)\}\$ in \$Cˆ5\$ . We show that a unital C*-algebra A has the weak expectation property if and only if \$A {\textbackslash}textbackslashotimesmin (Cˆ5/J) = A {\textbackslash}textbackslashotimesmax (Cˆ5/J)\$ (here {\textbackslash}textbackslashotimesmin and {\textbackslash}textbackslashotimesmax are the minimal and the maximal operator system tensor products, respectively, and \$Cˆ5/J\$ is the operator system quotient of \$Cˆ5\$ by \$J\$). We express the Kirchberg conjecture ({KC}) in terms of a four dimensional operator system problem. We prove that {KC} has an affirmative answer if and only if \$Cˆ5/J\$ has the double commutant expectation property if and only if \$C5/J {\textbackslash}textbackslashotimesmin C5/J = C5/J {\textbackslash}textbackslashotimesc C5/J\$ (here {\textbackslash}textbackslashotimesc represents the commuting operator system tensor product).},

	abstract = {The goal of harmonic analysis on a (noncommutative) group is to decompose the most “natural” unitary representations of this group (like the regular representation) on irreducible ones. The infinite-dimensional unitary group U(∞) is one of the basic examples of “big” groups whose irreducible representations depend on infinitely many parameters. Our aim is to explain what the harmonic analysis on U(∞) consists of. We deal with unitary representations of a reasonable class, which are in 1–1 correspondence with characters (central, positive definite, normalized functions on U(∞)). The decomposition of any representation of this class is described by a probability measure (called spectral measure) on the space of indecomposable characters. The indecomposable characters were found by Dan Voiculescu in 1976. The main result of the present paper consists in explicitly constructing a 4-parameter family of “natural” representations and computing their characters. We view these representations as a substitute of the nonexisting regular representation of U(∞). We state the problem of harmonic analysis on U(∞) as the problem of computing the spectral measures for these “natural” representations. A solution to this problem is given in the next paper (Harmonic analysis on the infinite-dimensional unitary group and determinantal point processes, math/0109194, to appear in Ann. Math.), joint with Alexei Borodin. We also prove a few auxiliary general results. In particular, it is proved that the spectral measure of any character of U(∞) can be approximated by a sequence of (discrete) spectral measures for the restrictions of the character to the compact unitary groups U(N). This fact is a starting point for computing spectral measures.},

To pose an equivalent question in the language of multivariate statistics, what is the distribution of the smallest eigenvalue of a matrix from the central Wishart distribution in the null case? We give new results giving the distribution as a simple recursion. This includes the more difficult case when n – m is an even integer, without resorting to zonal polynomials and hypergeometric functions of matrix arguments. With the recursion, one can obtain exact expressions for the density and the moments of the distribution in terms of functions usually no more complicated than polynomials, exponentials, and at worst ordinary hypergeometric functions. We further elaborate on the special cases when n – m = 0, 1, 2, and 3 and give a numerical table of the expected values for 2 ⩽ m ⩽ 25 and 0 ⩽ n – m ⩽ 25.},

More generally, extending a result of Etingof–Gelaki and Izumi–Kosaki we describe all pairs of compact separable monoidally equivalent groups. The proofs rely on the theory of ergodic actions of compact groups developed by Landstad and Wassermann and on its algebraic counterpart developed by Etingof and Gelaki for the classification of triangular semisimple Hopf algebras. We give a self-contained account of amenability of tensor categories, fusion rings and discrete quantum groups, and prove an analog of Radford's theorem on minimal Hopf subalgebras of quasitriangular Hopf algebras for compact quantum groups.},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose a simple definition of a locally compact quantum group in reduced form. By the word `reduced' we mean that we suppose the Haar weight to be faithful. So in fact we define and study an arbitrary locally compact quantum group, represented on the L2-space of its Haar weight. For this locally compact quantum group we construct the antipode with polar decomposition. We construct the associated multiplicative unitary and prove that it is manageable in the sense of Woronowicz. We define the modular element and prove the uniqueness of the Haar weights. Following [15] we construct the reduced dual, which will again be a reduced locally compact quantum group. Finally we prove that the second dual is canonically isomorphic to the original reduced locally compact quantum group, extending the Pontryagin duality theorem. Dans cet article nous proposons une définition simple des groupes quantiques localement compacts et réduits. L'adjectif ‘réduit’ exprime l'hypothèse de fidélité du poids de Haar. Nous définissons et étudions des groupes quantiques localement compacts arbitraires représentés sur l'espace L2 du poids de Haar. Nous construisons l'antipode de ce groupe quantique localement compact, ainsi que sa décomposition polaire. Nous construisons l'unitaire multiplicatif associé et nous démontrons qu'il est maniable au sens de Woronowicz. Nous définissons l'élément modulaire et démontrons l'unicité des poids de Haar. En nous inspirant de [15] nous construisons le dual réduit, qui est de nouveau un groupe quantique localement compact et réduit. Finalement, nous démontrons que le groupe quantique bidual est isomorphe au groupe quantique de départ, ce qui constitue une généralisation du théorème de dualité de Pontryagin.},

In the general case we also get a very simple proof that nuclearity is preserved under the deformation. We show how our approach leads to quantum groups and investigate their duality.

	abstract = {We study the matricial field ({MF}) property for certain reduced crossed product C*-algebras and their traces. Using classification techniques and induced K-theoretic dynamics, we show that reduced crossed products of {ASH}-algebras of real rank zero by free groups are {MF} if and only if they are stably finite. We also examine traces on these crossed products and show they always admit certain finite dimensional approximation properties. Combining these results with recent progress in Elliott's Classification Program, it follows that if \$A\$ is a separable, simple, unital, nuclear, monotracial C*-algebra satisfying the {UCT}, then \$A {\textbackslash}textbackslashrtimes\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashlambda\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{F\}\_r\$ is {MF} for any action \${\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\$. Appealing to a result of Ozawa, R\{{\textbackslash}textbackslasho\}rdam, and Sato, we show that discrete groups of the form \$G {\textbackslash}textbackslashrtimes {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{F\}\_r\$ with \$G\$ amenable admit {MF} reduced group C*-algebras In the process, some new permanence properties of {MF} algebras are obtained which are of independent interest. In particular, minimal tensor products of {MF} algebras are again {MF} provided one of the factors is exact.},

In this work, we show that the Imprimitivity Theorem for induced algebras, Green's Imprimitivity Theorem for actions of groups, and Mansfield's Imprimitivity Theorem for coactions of groups can all be viewed as natural equivalences between various crossed-product functors among certain equivariant categories. The categories involved have C*-algebras with actions or coactions (or both) of a fixed locally compact group G as their objects, and equivariant equivalence classes of right-Hilbert bimodules as their morphisms. Composition is given by the balanced tensor product of bimodules. The functors involved arise from taking crossed products; restricting, inflating, and decomposing actions and coactions; inducing actions; and various combinations of these. Several applications of this categorical approach are also presented, including some intriguing relationships between the Green and Mansfield bimodules, and between restriction and induction of representations.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02556},
	abstract = {An exotic crossed product is a way of associating a C*-algebra to each C*-dynamical system that generalizes the well-known universal and reduced crossed products. Exotic crossed products provide natural generalizations of, and tools to study, exotic group C*-algebras as recently considered by Brown-Guentner and others. They also form an essential part of a recent program to reformulate the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients so as to mollify the counterexamples caused by failures of exactness. In this paper, we survey some constructions of exotic group algebras and exotic crossed products. Summarising our earlier work, we single out a large class of crossed products — the correspondence functors — that have many properties known for the maximal and reduced crossed products: for example, they extend to categories of equivariant correspondences, and have a compatible descent morphism in {KK}-theory. Combined with known results on K-amenability and the Baum-Connes conjecture, this allows us to compute the K-theory of many exotic group algebras. It also gives new information about the reformulation of the Baum-Connes Conjecture mentioned above. Finally, we present some new results relating exotic crossed products for a group and its closed subgroups, and discuss connections with the reformulated Baum-Connes conjecture.},

	abstract = {In this partly expository paper we compare three different categories of C*-algebras in which crossed-product duality can be formulated, both for actions and for coactions of locally compact groups. In these categories, the isomorphisms correspond to C*-algebra isomorphisms, imprimitivity bimodules, and outer conjugacies, respectively. In each case, a variation of the fixed-point functor that arises from classical Landstad duality is used to obtain a quasi-inverse for a crossed-product functor. To compare the various cases, we describe in a formal way our view of the fixed-point functor as an "inversion" of the process of forming a crossed product. In some cases, we obtain what we call "good" inversions, while in others we do not. For the outer-conjugacy categories, we generalize a theorem of Pedersen to obtain a fixed-point functor that is quasi-inverse to the reduced-crossed-product functor for actions, and we show that this gives a good inversion. For coactions, we prove a partial version of Pedersen's theorem that allows us to define a fixed-point functor, but the question of whether it is a quasi-inverse for the crossed-product functor remains open.},

Here we introduce and study analogues of these properties for coaction functors, making sure that the properties are preserved when the coaction functors are composed with the full crossed product to make a crossed-product functor. The new properties for coaction functors studied here are functoriality for generalized homomorphisms and the correspondence property. We particularly study the connections with the ideal property. The study of functoriality for generalized homomorphisms requires a detailed development of the Fischer construction of maximalization of coactions with regard to possibly degenerate homomorphisms into multiplier algebras. We verify that all "{KLQ}" functors arising from large ideals of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra \$B(G)\$ have all the properties we study, and at the opposite extreme we give an example of a coaction functor having none of the properties.},

We study O(H), the subalgebra of invariants of H under the adjoint coaction, and prove that it is closely related to questions about the antipode and the integral. It may differ from C(H), the subalgebra of cocommutative elements of H. In fact, we prove that if H is unimodular then C(H)=O(H) is equivalent to assuming that the antipode is an involution. We prove that if H is a semisimple Hopf algebra over an algebraically closed field then O(H∗) is a symmetric Frobenius algebra containing the left integral of H∗. This enables us to prove that if H is also cosemisimple then C(H∗), C(H) are all separable algebras. It has been recently shown by Etingof and Gelaki (On finite-dimensional semisimple and cosemisimple Hopf algebras in positive characteristic, preprint) that in this situation S2=id and hence O(H)=C(H). In characteristic 0 semisimple Hopf algebras are cosemisimple and O(H∗) and C(H∗) coincide (and equal the so-called “character ring”). In positive characteristic O(H)≠C(H) in some cases, and O(H) may be a more natural object. For example, quasitriangular Hopf algebras are endowed with an algebra homomorphism between O(H∗) and the center of H. We show that if this homomorphism is a monomorphism then H is factorizable (a notion connected to computing invariants of 3-manifolds). We prove that if (H,R) is factorizable and semisimple then it is cosemisimple and so C(H∗) and C(H) are separable algebras. We apply these results to the associated Yetter–Drinfeld category.},

We prove the existence of a counit and an antipode. If A has an identity, we have a usual Hopf algebra. We also consider the case where A is a *-algebra.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05524},
	abstract = {In a locally \${\textbackslash}textbackslashlambda\$-presentable category, with \${\textbackslash}textbackslashlambda\$ a regular cardinal, classes of objects that are injective with respect to a family of morphisms whose domains and codomains are \${\textbackslash}textbackslashlambda\$-presentable, are known to be characterized by their closure under products, \${\textbackslash}textbackslashlambda\$-directed colimits and \${\textbackslash}textbackslashlambda\$-pure subobjects. Replacing the strict commutativity of diagrams by "commutativity up to \${\textbackslash}textbackslashvarepsilon\$", this paper provides an "approximate version" of this characterization for categories enriched over metric spaces. It entails a detailed discussion of the needed \${\textbackslash}textbackslashvarepsilon\$-generalizations of the notion of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashlambda\$-purity. The categorical theory is being applied to the locally \${\textbackslash}textbackslashaleph\_1\$-presentable category of Banach spaces and their linear operators of norm at most 1, culminating in a largely categorical proof for the existence of the so-called Gurarii Banach space.},

The construction behaves well under certain additional technical assumptions on Ω, the most important of which is regularity, meaning that C 0 ( G ) Ω ⋊ G is isomorphic to the algebra of compact operators on some Hilbert space. In particular, then A Ω is stably isomorphic to the iterated twisted crossed product G ˆ op ⋉ Ω G ⋉ A . Also, in good situations, the C ⁎ -algebra A Ω carries a left action of the deformed quantum group G Ω and we have an isomorphism G Ω ⋉ A Ω ≅ G ⋉ A . When G is a genuine locally compact group, we show that the action of G on C 0 ( G ) Ω = C r ⁎ ( G ˆ ; Ω ) is always integrable. Stronger assumptions of properness and saturation of the action imply regularity. As an example, we make a preliminary analysis of the cocycles on the duals of some solvable Lie groups recently constructed by Bieliavsky et al., and discuss the relation of our construction to that of Bieliavsky and Gayral.},

We have no example of {\textbackslash}textbackslash'etale groupoids which are not weakly inner amenable. For weakly inner amenable {\textbackslash}textbackslash'etale groupoids we prove the equivalence of six natural notions of exactness: (1) strong amenability at infinity; (2) amenability at infinity; (3) nuclearity of the uniform (Roe) algebra of the groupoid; (4) exactness of this \$Cˆ*\$-algebra; (5) exactness of the groupoid in the sense of Kirchberg-Wassermann; (6) exactness of its reduced Cˆ*-algebra.

	abstract = {A general commutation theorem is proved for tensor products of von Neumann algebras over common von Neumann subalgebras. Roughly speaking, if the non-common parts of two von Neumann algebras M1 and M2 on the same Hilbert space are appropriately separated by commuting type I von Neumann algebras N1 and N2, then the commutant of the von Neumann algebra generated by M1 and M2 is generated by the relative commutants M′1∩N1 and M′2∩N2, as well as by the intersection of the commutants of all concerned von Neumann algebras. This theorem extends both Tomita's classical commutation theorem and a splitting result in tensor products, proved recently in the factor case by L. Ge and R. V. Kadison. Applications are given to a decomposition criterion in ordinary tensor products and to a partial solution of a conjecture of S. Popa concerning the maximal injectivity of tensor products of maximal injective von Neumann subalgebras.},

We develop methods to show that cocycle entropy satisfies many of the properties of classical amenable entropy theory, but applies in much greater generality to actions of non-amenable groups. One key ingredient in our approach is a proof of a subadditive convergence principle which is valid for measure-preserving amenable equivalence relations, going beyond the Ornstein-Weiss Lemma for amenable groups. For a large class of countable groups, which may in fact include all of them, we prove the Shannon-{McMillan}-Breiman pointwise convergence theorem for cocycle entropy in their measure-preserving actions. We also compare cocycle entropy to Rokhlin entropy, and using an important recent result of Seward we show that they coincide for free, ergodic actions of any countable group in the class. Finally, we use the example of the free group to demonstrate the geometric significance of the entropy equipartition property implied by the Shannon-{McMillan}-Breiman theorem.},

As in the prequel, where we considered the eigenvalue aspect of the problem, the non-random limiting value is shown to depend explicitly on the limiting singular value distribution of the unperturbed matrix via an integral transforms that linearizes rectangular additive convolution in free probability theory. The large matrix limit of the extreme singular values of the perturbed matrix differs from that of the original matrix if and only if the singular values of the perturbing matrix are above a certain critical threshold which depends on this same aforementioned integral transform. We examine the consequence of this singular value phase transition on the associated left and right singular eigenvectors and discuss the finite \$n\$ fluctuations above these non-random limits.},

	abstract = {The analytic von Neumann regular closure \$R({\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma})\$ of a complex group algebra \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashC}{\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$ was introduced by Linnell and Schick. This ring is the smallest \$*\$-regular subring in the algebra of affiliated operators \$U({\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma})\$ containing \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashC}{\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$. We prove that all the algebraic von Neumann regular closures corresponding to sofic representations of an amenable group are isomorphic to \$R({\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma})\$. This result can be viewed as a structural generalization of L{\textbackslash}textbackslash"uck's Approximation Theorem. {\textbackslash}textbackslashnoindent The main tool of the proof which might be of independent interest is that an amenable group algebra \$K{\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$ over any field \$K\$ can be embedded to the rank completion of an ultramatricial algebra.},

	abstract = {Let \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$ be a discrete group. Following Linnell and Schick one can define a continuous ring \$c({\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma})\$ associated with \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$. They proved that if the Atiyah Conjecture holds for a torsion-free group \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$, then \$c({\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma})\$ is a skew field. Also, if \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$ has torsion and the Strong Atiyah Conjecture holds for \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$, then \$c({\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma})\$ is a matrix ring over a skew field. The simplest example when the Strong Atiyah Conjecture fails is the lamplighter group \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}=Z\_2{\textbackslash}textbackslashwr Z\$. It is known that \$C(Z\_2{\textbackslash}textbackslashwr Z)\$ does not even have a classical ring of quotients. Our main result is that if \$H\$ is amenable, then \$c(Z\_2{\textbackslash}textbackslashwr H)\$ is isomorphic to a continuous ring constructed by John von Neumann in the \$1930's\$.},

First, we generalize the result of Gaboriau and Lyons [{GL}07] to the setting of von Neumann's problem for equivalence relations, proving that for any non-amenable ergodic probability measure preserving (pmp) equivalence relation \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\}\$, the Bernoulli extension over a non-atomic base space \$(K, {\textbackslash}textbackslashkappa)\$ contains the orbit equivalence relation of a free ergodic pmp action of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{F\}\_2\$. Moreover, we provide conditions which imply that this holds for any non-trivial probability space \$K\$. Second, we use this result to prove that any non-amenable unimodular locally compact second countable group admits uncountably many free ergodic pmp actions which are pairwise not von Neumann equivalent (hence, pairwise not orbit equivalent).},

The completely positive rank behaves nicely with respect to direct sums, quotients, ideals and inductive limits. For abelian C∗-algebras it coincides with covering dimension of the spectrum and there are similar results for continuous trace algebras. As it turns out, a C∗-algebra is zero-dimensional precisely if it is {AF}. We consider various examples, particularly of one-dimensional C∗-algebras, like the irrational rotation algebras, the Bunce–Deddens algebras or Blackadar's simple unital projectionless C∗-algebra. Finally, we compare the completely positive rank to other concepts of noncommutative covering dimension, such as stable or real rank.},

	abstract = {We introduce a two-player nonlocal game, called the \$(G,H)\$-isomorphism game, where classical players can win with certainty if and only if the graphs \$G\$ and \$H\$ are isomorphic. We then define the notions of quantum and non-signalling isomorphism, by considering perfect quantum and non-signalling strategies for the \$(G,H)\$-isomorphism game, respectively. In the quantum case, we consider both the tensor product and commuting frameworks for nonlocal games. We prove that non-signalling isomorphism coincides with the well-studied notion of fractional isomorphism, thus giving the latter an operational interpretation. Second, we show that, in the tensor product framework, quantum isomorphism is equivalent to the feasibility of two polynomial systems in non-commuting variables, obtained by relaxing the standard integer programming formulations for graph isomorphism to Hermitian variables. On the basis of this correspondence, we show that quantum isomorphic graphs are necessarily cospectral. Finally, we provide a construction for reducing linear binary constraint system games to isomorphism games. This allows us to produce quantum isomorphic graphs that are nevertheless not isomorphic. Furthermore, it allows us to show that our two notions of quantum isomorphism, from the tensor product and commuting frameworks, are in fact distinct relations, and that the latter is undecidable. Our construction is related to the {FGLSS} reduction from inapproximability literature, as well as the {CFI} construction.},

In contrast to related results for amenable groups, where uniqueness of strongly outer actions on the Jiang-Su algebra is expected, we show that uniqueness fails for all nonamenable groups, and that the failure is drastic. Our main result implies that if \$G\$ contains a copy of the free group, then there exist uncountable many, non-cocycle conjugate strongly outer actions of \$G\$ on any Jiang-Su stable tracial C*-algebra. Similar conclusions apply for outer actions on {McDuff} tracial von Neumann algebras. We moreover show that \$G\$ is amenable if and only if the Bernoulli shift on a finite strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra absorbs the trivial action on the Jiang-Su algebra. Our methods consist in a careful study of weak containments of the Koopman representations of different Bernoulli-type actions.},

We use this notion to classify *-homomorphisms from separable, unital, nuclear C*-algebras into ultrapowers of simple, unital, nuclear, Z-stable C*-algebras with compact extremal trace space up to 2-coloured equivalence by their behaviour on traces; this is based on a 1-coloured classification theorem for certain order zero maps, also in terms of tracial data. As an application we calculate the nuclear dimension of non-{AF}, simple, separable, unital, nuclear, Z-stable C*-algebras with compact extremal trace space: it is 1. In the case that the extremal trace space also has finite topological covering dimension, this confirms the remaining open implication of the Toms-Winter conjecture. Inspired by homotopy-rigidity theorems in geometry and topology, we derive a "homotopy equivalence implies isomorphism" result for large classes of C*-algebras with finite nuclear dimension.},

Among these families are \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashit reflexive games,\} which are characterised as the hardest non-signalling games that can be won using a given set of strategies. We introduce \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashit imitation games,\} in which the players display linked behaviour, and which contains as subclasses the classes of variable assignment games, binary constraint system games, synchronous games, many games based on graphs, and \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashit unique\} games. We associate a C*-algebra \$Cˆ*({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{G\})\$ to any imitation game \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{G\}\$, and show that the existence of perfect quantum commuting (resp.{\textbackslash}textbackslash quantum, local) strategies of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{G\}\$ can be characterised in terms of properties of this C*-algebra, extending known results about synchronous games. We single out a subclass of imitation games, which we call \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashit mirror games,\} and provide a characterisation of their quantum commuting strategies that has an algebraic flavour, showing in addition that their approximately quantum perfect strategies arise from amenable traces on the encoding C*-algebra.

	abstract = {We work within the framework of the Alpha-Theory introduced by Benci and Di Nasso. The Alpha-Theory postulates a few natural properties for an infinite "ideal" number \${\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\$. The formulation provides an elementary axiomatics for the methods of abstract ultra-Ramsey theory. The main results are Theorem 10, Theorem 57, Theorem 67 and Theorem 73. Theorem 10 is an infinite-dimensional extension of the celebrated Ramsey's Theorem. We show that corollaries of this result include the Galvin-Pirky Theorem, the Silver Theorem and the \${\textbackslash}textbackslashvec\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\}\$-Ellentuck Theorem. We prove that, under the assumption of the \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathfrak\{c\}ˆ\{+\}\$-enlarging property, the \${\textbackslash}textbackslashvec\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\}\$-Ellentuck Theorem is equivalent to the Ultra-Ellentuck Theorem of Todorcevic. Theorem 57 is an abstraction of Theorem 10 to the setting of triples \$({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\},{\textbackslash}textbackslashle,r)\$ where \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\}{\textbackslash}textbackslashnot={\textbackslash}textbackslashemptyset\$, \${\textbackslash}textbackslashle\$ is a quasi-order on \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\}\$ and \$r\$ is a function with domain \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\}{\textbackslash}textbackslashtimes {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{R\}\$. We use Theorem 57 to develop the Abstract \${\textbackslash}textbackslashvec\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\}\$-Ellentuck Theorem, Theorem 67, and the Abstract Ultra-Ellentuck Theorem, Theorem 73, extending the Abstract Ellentuck Theorem along the same lines as the \${\textbackslash}textbackslashvec\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\}\$-Ellentuck Theorem and Ultra-Ellentuck Theorem extend the Ellentuck Theorem, respectively.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03784},
	abstract = {The Kantorovich-Rubinshtein metric is an \$Lˆ1\$-like metric on spaces of probability distributions that enjoys several serendipitous properties. It is complete separable if the underlying metric space of points is complete separable, and in that case it metrizes the weak topology. We introduce a variant of that construction in the realm of quasi-metric spaces, and prove that it is algebraic Yoneda-complete as soon as the underlying quasi-metric space of points is algebraic Yoneda-complete, and that the associated topology is the weak topology. We do this not only for probability distributions, represented as normalized continuous valuations, but also for subprobability distributions, for various hyperspaces, and in general for different brands of functionals. Those functionals model probabilistic choice, angelic and demonic non-deterministic choice, and their combinations. The mathematics needed for those results are more demanding than in the simpler case of metric spaces. To obtain our results, we prove a few other results that have independent interest, notably: continuous Yoneda-complete spaces are consonant; on a continuous Yoneda-complete space, the Scott topology on the space of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashoverline\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{R\}\}\_+\$-valued lower semicontinuous maps coincides with the compact-open and Isbell topologies, and the subspace topology on spaces of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\$-Lipschitz continuous maps also coincides with the topology of pointwise convergence, and is stably compact; we introduce and study the so-called Lipschitz-regular quasi-metric spaces, and we show that the formal ball functor induces a Kock-Z{\textbackslash}textbackslash"oberlein monad, of which all algebras are Lipschitz-regular; and we prove a minimax theorem where one of the spaces is not compact Hausdorff, but merely compact.},

Its central concepts have their origin in the idea of approximating ideal objects by their relatively finite or, more generally, relatively compact parts. The development of domain theory in recent years was mainly motivated by questions in denotational semantics and the theory of computation. But since 2008, domain theoretical notions and methods are used in the theory of C∗C∗{\textbackslash}textbackslashhbox \{C\}ˆ*-algebras in connection with the Cuntz semigroup. This paper is largely expository. It presents those notions of domain theory that seem to be relevant for the theory of Cuntz semigroups and have sometimes been developed independently in both communities. It also contains a new aspect in presenting results of Elliott, Ivanescu and Santiago on the cone of traces of a C∗C∗{\textbackslash}textbackslashhbox \{C\}ˆ*-algebra as a particular case of the dual of a Cuntz semigroup.},

	abstract = {We analyze the sequence obtained by consecutive applications of the Cantor–Bendixson derivative for a noncommutative scattered C⁎-algebra A, using the ideal {IAt}(A) generated by the minimal projections of A. With its help, we present some fundamental results concerning scattered C⁎-algebras, in a manner parallel to the commutative case of scattered compact or locally compact Hausdorff spaces and superatomic Boolean algebras. It also allows us to formulate problems which have motivated the “cardinal sequences” programme in the classical topology, in the noncommutative context. This leads to some new constructions of noncommutative scattered C⁎-algebras and new open problems. In particular, we construct a type I C⁎-algebra which is the inductive limit of stable ideals Aα, along an uncountable limit ordinal λ, such that Aα+1/Aα is ⁎-isomorphic to the algebra of all compact operators on a separable Hilbert space and Aα+1 is σ-unital and stable for each α{\textbackslash}textlessλ, but A is not stable and where all ideals of A are of the form Aα. In particular, A is a nonseparable C⁎-algebra with no ideal which is maximal among the stable ideals. This answers a question of M. Rørdam in the nonseparable case. All the above C⁎-algebras Aαs and A satisfy the following version of the definition of an {AF} algebra: any finite subset can be approximated from a finite-dimensional subalgebra. Two more complex constructions based on the language developed in this paper are presented in separate papers [21], [22].},

	abstract = {The main theorem of this paper is that compact metric spaces which are locally n-connected and which have cohomological dimension ⩽n for some n are precisely the spaces which are cell-like images of finite polyhedra. We show that this leads to a well-defined simple homotopy theory for such spaces. We also show that these spaces are precisely the compact metric spaces which are limits of polyhedra in Gromov’s topological moduli spaces M(n,ρ) for some choice of ρ and n. In addition, we prove that every precompact subset of M(n,ρ) contains only finitely many simple homotopy types. In the final section, we discuss the problem of determining which metric spaces are limits of closed manifolds in M(n,ρ) for some n and ρ.},

For compacta fine shape coincides with strong shape, and in general it involves a stronger form of coherence which amounts to taking into account a natural topology on the indexing sets. Both Steenrod-Sitnikov homology and Čech cohomology are proved to be invariant under fine shape, which cannot be said of any previously known shape theory. In general, fine shape invariance of a (co)homology theory is a strong form of homotopy invariance which implies the map excision axiom.},

Such classes of structures have been called Ramsey classes. Nesetril and Roedl showed that they have the amalgamation property, and therefore each such class has a homogeneous Fraisse-limit. Ramsey classes have recently attracted attention due to a surprising link with the notion of extreme amenability from topological dynamics. Other applications of Ramsey classes include reduct classification of homogeneous structures. We give a survey of the various fundamental Ramsey classes and their (often tricky) combinatorial proofs, and about various methods to derive new Ramsey classes from known Ramsey classes. Finally, we state open problems related to a potential classification of Ramsey classes.},

If the trace space \$T(A)\$ is a Bauer simplex and \${\textbackslash}textbackslashpartial\_eT(A)\$ has finite \$G\$-orbits, we show that \${\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\$ is strongly outer if and only if \${\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha{\textbackslash}textbackslashotimes{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{id\}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{Z\}\}\$ has the weak tracial Rokhlin property.

When the covering dimension of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashpartial\_eT(A)\$ is finite, we prove that \${\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\$ is cocycle conjugate to \${\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha{\textbackslash}textbackslashotimes{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{id\}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{Z\}\}\$.

A key step in the proof shows that if the foliation of a matchbox manifold has equicontinuous dynamics, then it is minimal. Moreover, we then show that a matchbox manifold with equicontinuous dynamics is homeomorphic to a weak solenoid. A result of Effros is used to conclude that a homogeneous matchbox manifold has equicontinuous dynamics, and the main theorem is a consequence. The proofs of these results combine techniques from the theory of foliations and pseudogroups, along with methods from topological dynamics and coding theory for pseudogroup actions. These techniques and results provide a framework for the study of matchbox manifolds in general, and exceptional minimal sets of smooth foliations.},

	abstract = {Cohomology for actions of free abelian groups on the Cantor set has (when endowed with an order structure) provided a complete invariance for orbit equivalence. In this paper, we study a particular class of actions of such groups called odometers (or profinite actions) and investigate their cohomology. We show that for a free, minimal \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashZˆ}\{d\}\$-odometer, the first cohomology group provides a complete invariant for the action up to conjugacy. This is in contrast with the situation for orbit equivalence where it is the cohomology in dimension \$d\$ which provides the invariant. We also consider classification up to isomorphism and continuous orbit equivalence.},

A finite rank torsion-free abelian group \$X\$ is algebraically isomorphic to a canonical dense subgroup \$X\_G\$ of its Pontryagin dual \$G\$. A morphism between protori lifts to a product morphism between the universal covers, so morphisms in the category can be studied as pairs of maps: homomorphisms between finitely generated profinite abelian groups and linear maps between finite-dimensional real vector spaces. A concept of non-Archimedean dimension is introduced which acts a useful invariant for classifying protori.},

	abstract = {With the advent of hip arthroscopy, there has come an increased recognition of intra-articular hip pathologies and improved techniques for the management of these various pathologies. While mechanical problems can often be corrected through surgery, the functional deficits must be corrected through the rehabilitation process. Therefore, the evolution of hip arthroscopy has necessitated a progression in hip rehabilitation to insure optimal postsurgical results. Understanding the process of rehabilitation from preoperative education to the patient’s achievement of full function is an integral part of the patient reaching their full potential postsurgery. While it is generally accepted that rehabilitation after hip arthroscopy is vitally important, there is limited evidence-based research to support the rehabilitative guidelines. Rehabilitative methodology and techniques commonly employed after minimally invasive surgical techniques for other joints, such as the knee, shoulder, elbow, and ankle, have found application in the management of hip disorders. Understanding and respecting basic principles is always key to obtaining successful outcomes with any technique. Keeping these principles in mind, this chapter attempts to provide the clinician with guidelines for the rehabilitation of the hip.},

	abstract = {The repetitive nature of walking can lead to joint stress and associated complications due to the rate of loading ({ROL}) experienced with each step. Previous research suggests that an individual's gait kinematics at initial contact gives rise to the {ROL}, and a repetitive, high {ROL} may lead to several disorders, including osteoarthritis. In this study, we investigated the short-term learning effects of using a gait monitoring system to change an individual's gait pattern and reduce the {ROL}. Twelve healthy women participated in the study, and we analyzed the gait characteristics pre- and post-training with the gait monitoring system. Subjects also underwent a pre-post assessment to explore the short-term changes in proprioceptive acuity that resulted from this type of training. Our results indicate that using a gait monitoring system can effectively change the gait kinematics, leading to a reduced {ROL} experienced, and can increase proprioceptive acuity. These findings suggest that a gait monitoring system has the potential to decrease the risk of certain joint degenerative diseases, and future long-term studies are needed to explore the gait adaptations that occur through this type of training.},

The aim of this paper was to explore how training with this knee brace affected the gait pattern utilized, rate of loading ({ROL}), and proprioceptive acuity. Methods Fifteen healthy women wore this knee brace that provided audible feedback on gait kinematics for a 30-min training period. We performed pre- and post-gait analyses and proprioceptive acuity assessments to determine gait learning and adaptation with this training. Results Post-training significant changes were seen in the knee angle prior to and at initial contact and peak knee extensor, flexor, and adductor moments, which ultimately led to a reduced {ROL} experienced. Subjects also had improved proprioceptive acuity post-training. Interpretations Our results indicate that using a feedback-based gait monitoring knee brace can change the gait pattern by increasing the knee flexion angle during the swing to stance transition. Though there was an approximate 25\% decrease in the {ROL} experienced, there was also an increase in the knee adductor moment. Future long-term studies are needed to further explore the positive and negative effects of feedback-based gait monitoring knee brace on individuals with a compromised knee joint, such as those post-anterior cruciate ligament injury.},

The application drives the data processing unit to feeding the headphone with electric signals related to the kinematic measures. Consequently, the user is audio-alerted, via headphone, of his/her own equilibrium, hearing a pleasant sound when in a stable equilibrium, or an increasing bothering sound when in an increasing unstable condition. Tests were conducted on a group of six older subjects (59y-61y, {SD} = 2.09y) and a group of four young subjects (21y-26y, {SD} = 2.88y) to underline difference in effectiveness of the system, if any, related to the age of the users. For each subject, standing balance tests were performed in normal or altered conditions, such as, open or closed eyes, and on a solid or foam surface. The system was evaluated in terms of usability, reliability, and effectiveness in improving the subject's balance in all conditions. As a result, the system successfully helped the subjects in reducing the body swaying within 10.65\%-65.90\%, differences depending on subjects’ age and test conditions.},

	abstract = {. Ten subjects suffering from incomplete spinal cord injuries, clinically diagnosed as walking with Trendelenburg gait, underwent a 2 month therapy program to strengthen their muscles and reduce their gait abnormalities. Therapy involved muscle strengthening and gait training for 2 h a day, 5 days a week in a clinic. Biofeedback was also accomplished for 30 min each training day on all subjects. In addition, five of the subjects wore a two-channel electromyogram ({EMG}) biofeedback training device at home to see if neuromuscular re-education outside of the clinical setting could speed their recovery. The difference for these five subjects was that they would have continuous biofeedback therapy every time they walked and not biofeedback limited to only 30 min a day. Since weakness of the gluteus medius muscles is the prime contributor to Trendelenburg gait, the device provided warning tones giving feedback of improper gait through bilateral assessment of the use of the gluteus medius muscles. If too little gluteus medius activity was seen on the affected side or the step was too short in duration, the microprocessor provided an audio cue to the subjects alerting them to correct the deficit. Subjects only undergoing clinical therapy showed about a 50\% reduction in hip drop due to therapy. However, the group that used the home training device showed almost normal gait after the 2 month period.},

We show that there exists an isomorphism in the category of unital \$Cˆ*\$-algebras and unital \$*\$-homomorphisms between the inductive limit of an inductive system of Toeplitz algebras over a directed set defined by a set of natural numbers and a reduced semigroup \$Cˆ*\$-algebra for a semigroup in the group of all rational numbers.

	abstract = {Given a closed surface X, the covering solenoid {\textbackslash}textlesstex-math{\textbackslash}textgreater\$X\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty\${\textbackslash}textless/tex-math{\textbackslash}textgreater is by definition the inverse limit of all finite covering surfaces over X. If the genus of X is greater than one, then there is only one homeomorphism type of covering solenoid; it is called the universal hyperbolic solenoid. In this paper we describe the topology of {\textbackslash}textlesstex-math{\textbackslash}textgreater\${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}(X\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty)\${\textbackslash}textless/tex-math{\textbackslash}textgreater, the mapping class group of the universal hyperbolic solenoid. Central to this description is the notion of a virtual automorphism group. The main result is that there is a natural isomorphism of the baseleaf preserving mapping class group of {\textbackslash}textlesstex-math{\textbackslash}textgreater\$X\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty\${\textbackslash}textless/tex-math{\textbackslash}textgreater onto the virtual automorphism group of {\textbackslash}textlesstex-math{\textbackslash}textgreater\${\textbackslash}textbackslashpi\_1(X, {\textbackslash}textbackslashast)\${\textbackslash}textless/tex-math{\textbackslash}textgreater. This may be regarded as a genus independent generalization of the theorem of Dehn, Nielsen, Baer, and Epstein that the pointed mapping class group {\textbackslash}textlesstex-math{\textbackslash}textgreater\${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}(X, {\textbackslash}textbackslashast)\${\textbackslash}textless/tex-math{\textbackslash}textgreater is isomorphic to the automorphism group of {\textbackslash}textlesstex-math{\textbackslash}textgreater\${\textbackslash}textbackslashpi\_1(X, {\textbackslash}textbackslashast)\${\textbackslash}textless/tex-math{\textbackslash}textgreater.},

In this paper we show that this question has a positive answer when the acting group is locally nilpotent. This extends previous results obtained by Gao-Jackson for abelian groups and by Jackson-Kechris-Louveau for finitely generated nilpotent-by-finite groups. Our proof is based on a mixture of coarse geometric properties of locally nilpotent groups together with an adaptation of the Gao-Jackson machinery.},

It covers the following topics: von Neumann algebras arising from discrete measured groupoids, purely infinite Cuntz-Krieger algebras, filtered K-theory over finite topological spaces, C*-algebras associated to shift spaces (or subshifts), graph C*-algebras, irrational extended rotation algebras that are shown to be C*-alloys, free probability, renewal systems, the Grothendieck Theorem for jointly completely bounded bilinear forms on C*-algebras, Cuntz-Li algebras associated with the a-adic numbers, crossed products of injective endomorphisms (the so-called Stacey crossed products), the interplay between dynamical systems, operator algebras and wavelets on fractals, C*-completions of the Hecke algebra of a Hecke pair, semiprojective C*-algebras, and the topological dimension of type I C*-algebras. Operator Algebra and Dynamics will serve as a useful resource for a broad spectrum of researchers and students in mathematics, physics, and engineering.},

Such partial actions are extremely widespread in mathematics, and the main aim of this paper is to prove two basic results concerning them. First, we obtain an explicit description of Exel's universal inverse semigroup , which has the property that partial actions of the group G give rise to actions of the inverse semigroup . We apply this result to the theory of graph immersions. Second, we prove that each partial group action is the restriction of a universal global group action. We describe some applications of this result to group theory and the theory of E-unitary inverse semigroups.},

Furthermore, it will be proved that under a suitable condition the partial skew groupoid ring corresponding to a partial action by a connected groupoid is isomorphic to a specific partial skew group ring. We also present a Morita theory and a Galois theory related to these partial actions as well as considerations about the strictness of the corresponding Morita contexts. Semisimplicity, separability and Frobenius properties of the corresponding partial skew groupoid rings are also considered.},

We show that certain sets of places with nice properties (e.g., prime divisors, places of maximal rank, zero-dimensional discrete places) lie dense in this topology. Further, we give several equivalent characterizations of fields that are large, in the sense of F. Pop's Annals paper Embedding problems over large fields. We also study the question whether a field K is existentially closed in an extension field L if L admits a K-rational place. In the appendix, we prove the fact that the Zariski space with the Zariski topology is quasi-compact and that it is a spectral space.},

	abstract = {We study equivalence relations that arise from translation actions \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}{\textbackslash}textbackslashcurvearrowright G\$ which are associated to dense embeddings \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}{\textbackslash}{textlessG}\$ of countable groups into second countable locally compact groups. Assuming that \$G\$ is simply connected and the action \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}{\textbackslash}textbackslashcurvearrowright G\$ is strongly ergodic, we prove that \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}{\textbackslash}textbackslashcurvearrowright G\$ is orbit equivalent to another such translation action \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashLambda}{\textbackslash}textbackslashcurvearrowright H\$ if and only if there exists an isomorphism \${\textbackslash}textbackslashdelta:G{\textbackslash}textbackslashrightarrow H\$ such that \${\textbackslash}textbackslashdelta({\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma})={\textbackslash}{textbackslashLambda}\$. If \$G\$ is moreover a real algebraic group, then we establish analogous rigidity results for the translation actions of \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}\$ on homogeneous spaces of the form \$G/{\textbackslash}{textbackslashSigma}\$, where \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashSigma}{\textbackslash}{textlessG}\$ is either a discrete or an algebraic subgroup. We also prove that if \$G\$ is simply connected and the action \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}{\textbackslash}textbackslashcurvearrowright G\$ has property (T), then any cocycle \$w:{\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}{\textbackslash}textbackslashtimes G{\textbackslash}textbackslashrightarrow{\textbackslash}{textbackslashLambda}\$ with values into a countable group \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashLambda}\$ is cohomologous to a homomorphism \${\textbackslash}textbackslashdelta:{\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}{\textbackslash}textbackslashrightarrow{\textbackslash}{textbackslashLambda}\$. As a consequence, we deduce that the action \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}{\textbackslash}textbackslashcurvearrowright G\$ is orbit equivalent superrigid: any free nonsingular action \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashLambda}{\textbackslash}textbackslashcurvearrowright Y\$ which is orbit equivalent to \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}{\textbackslash}textbackslashcurvearrowright G\$, is necessarily conjugate to an induction of \${\textbackslash}{textbackslashGamma}{\textbackslash}textbackslashcurvearrowright G\$.},

In this paper, we study the case p=1 and construct infinitely many exotic embeddings. We also give a positive result under certain (co)homological hypotheses on the complement. Furthermore, we study the case (p,q,r)=(1,1,1) more in detail and show that the closures of the two components of S4−f(S1×S1×S1) are homeomorphic to the exterior of an embedded solid torus or Montesinos' twin in S4.},

We explicitly factor a holomorphic map between Stein manifolds through mapping cylinders in three different model structures and use these factorizations to prove implications between ostensibly different Oka properties of complex manifolds and holomorphic maps. We show that for Stein manifolds, several Oka properties coincide and are characterized by the geometric condition of ellipticity. Going beyond the Stein case to a study of cofibrant models of arbitrary complex manifolds, using the Jouanolou Trick, we obtain a geometric characterization of an Oka property for a large class of manifolds, extending our result for Stein manifolds. Finally, we prove a converse Oka Principle saying that certain notions of cofibrancy for manifolds are equivalent to being Stein.},

	abstract = {In mathematics, the Whitehead manifold is an open 3-manifold that is contractible, but not homeomorphic to R 3 \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashdisplaystyle {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb \{R\} ˆ\{3\}\} . J. H. C. Whitehead (1935) discovered this puzzling object while he was trying to prove the Poincaré conjecture, correcting an error in an earlier paper Whitehead (1934, theorem 3) where he incorrectly claimed that no such manifold exists. A contractible manifold is one that can continuously be shrunk to a point inside the manifold itself. For example, an open ball is a contractible manifold. All manifolds homeomorphic to the ball are contractible, too. One can ask whether all contractible manifolds are homeomorphic to a ball. For dimensions 1 and 2, the answer is classical and it is "yes". In dimension 2, it follows, for example, from the Riemann mapping theorem. Dimension 3 presents the first counterexample: the Whitehead manifold.},

In this article we use few literal expressions, equations, functions, etc. We barely suppose that the readers have studied manifolds, homology theory, or topics beyond them. Is there a nontrivial high dimensional knot? We first answer this question. After that, we explain local moves on high dimensional knots and the projections of high dimensional knots.},

This additional condition on the solenoidal Beltrami differentials can be written as a Banach norm in a subspace of solenoidal differentials. Moreover, this subspace is the completion under this norm of those solenoidal differentials locally constant at the fiber. As a toy example, we show how this technique works on a linear problem: We generalize the diophantine equation complex analytic extension problem to the respective solenoidal space.},

In the latter case, we describe all possible sets of periods for functions on such spaces, which are based on multiples of Sharkovsky's order.},

We get a generalization of the usual fibre lemma regarding preservation of a fibration sequence by R∞. The basic result is that for such I-diagrams N of nilpotent spaces the canonical commutation {mapR}∞{holimIN}→{cholimIR}∞Nis always a covering projection. This has clear implications for Sullivan–Quillen localization and completion theory and for rational models. On the way we are lead to a sufficient condition for the homotopy limit over a finite diagram to be non-empty or in fact r-connected for a given r⩾−1.},

This folk theorem is apparently due to Joyal, and has been generalized recently by Beke. However, in most cases of interest, such as the category of sheaves on a ringed space or the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a nice enough scheme, the abelian category in question also has a tensor product. The injective model structure is not well-suited to the tensor product. In this paper, we consider another method for constructing a model structure. We apply it to the category of sheaves on a well-behaved ringed space. The resulting flat model structure is compatible with the tensor product and all homomorphisms of ringed spaces.},

	abstract = {The commutative differential graded algebra \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{{PL}\}\}(X)\$ of polynomial forms on a simplicial set \$X\$ is a crucial tool in rational homotopy theory. In this note, we construct an integral version \$Aˆ\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}\}(X)\$ of \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{{PL}\}\}(X)\$. Our approach uses diagrams of chain complexes indexed by the category of finite sets and injections \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}\$ to model \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty\}\$ differential graded algebras by strictly commutative objects, called commutative \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}\$-dgas. We define a functor \$Aˆ\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}\}\$ from simplicial sets to commutative \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}\$-dgas and show that it is a commutative lift of the usual cochain algebra functor. In particular, it gives rise to a new construction of the \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty\}\$ dga of cochains. The functor \$Aˆ\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}\}\$ shares many properties of \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{{PL}\}\}\$, and can be viewed as a generalization of \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{{PL}\}\}\$ that works over arbitrary commutative ground rings. Working over the integers, a theorem by Mandell implies that \$Aˆ\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}\}(X)\$ determines the homotopy type of \$X\$ when \$X\$ is a nilpotent space of finite type.},

The key concept we introduce is that of a model approximation. Our key result says that if a category admits a model approximation then so does any diagram category with values in this category. From the homotopy theoretical point of view categories with model approximations have similar properties to those of model categories. They admit homotopy categories (localizations with respect to weak equivalences). They also can be used to construct derived functors by taking the analogs of fibrant and cofibrant replacements. A category with weak equivalences can have several useful model approximations. We take advantage of this possibility and in each situation choose one that suits our needs. In this way we prove all the fundamental properties of the homotopy colimit and limit: Fubini Theorem (the homotopy colimit -respectively limit- commutes with itself), Thomason's theorem about diagrams indexed by Grothendieck constructions, and cofinality statements. Since the model approximations we present here consist of certain functors "indexed by spaces", the key role in all our arguments is played by the geometric nature of the indexing categories.},

	abstract = {If \$S\$ is a topological monoid such that every homomorphism from \$S\$ to a second countable topological monoid \$T\$ is continuous, then we say that \$S\$ has \$automatic\$ \$continuity\$. In this paper, we show that many well-known, and extensively studied, monoids have automatic continuity with respect to some natural semigroup topology. Namely, the following have automatic continuity: the monoid \$B\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\}\}\$ of all binary relations on the natural numbers \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\}\$; the monoid \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\}\}\$ of partial transformations; the full transformation monoid \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\} ˆ {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\}\$; the monoid \${\textbackslash}textbackslashoperatorname\{Inj\}({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\})\$ of injective transformations on \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\}\$; the symmetric inverse monoid \$I\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\}\}\$; and the monoid \$C(2 ˆ {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\})\$ of continuous functions on the Cantor set \$2 ˆ {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\}\$. Additionally, we show that: \$B\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\}\}\$ has no Polish semigroup topologies; \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\}\}\$, \$C(2 ˆ {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\})\$, and the monoid \$C([0, 1] ˆ {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\})\$ of continuous functions on the Hilbert cube \$[0, 1] ˆ {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\}\$ each have a unique Polish semigroup topology; the monoid \${\textbackslash}textbackslashoperatorname\{End\}({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{Q\}, {\textbackslash}textbackslashleq)\$ of all order-endomorphisms of the rational numbers, and the monoid of endomorphisms of the countable random graph (the Rado graph) have at least one Polish semigroup topology; the monoid of self-embeddings of any Fra{\textbackslash}textbackslash"iss{\textbackslash}textbackslash'e limit which admits proper embeddings has at least two Polish semigroup topologies; \$I\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\}\}\$ has at least 3 Polish semigroup topologies, but a unique Polish inverse semigroup topology; and \${\textbackslash}textbackslashoperatorname\{Inj\}({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\})\$ and the monoid \${\textbackslash}textbackslashoperatorname\{Surj\}({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\})\$ of all surjective transformations of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{N\}\$ have infinitely many distinct Polish semigroup topologies.

We show in contrast that on higher cardinals κ, the existence of these principles is frequently independent of the {ZFC} axioms. Finally, we detail implications of these phenomena for the computation of strong homology groups and higher derived limits, deriving independence results in algebraic topology and homological algebra, respectively, in the process.},

The generic combinatorial \$n\$-simplex is a set-theoretic object that can be used to define the geometric realization of a simplicial complex without any reference to the Euclidean space. We present a theory of coinitial closure for general Fraisse classes. We study the coinitial closure of our class of selection maps. In the process, we develop further Fraisse theory, the theory of stellar moves, as well as the theory of cellular maps. It turns out that the coinitial closure of selection maps contains the class of face-preserving simplicial maps that are cellular on each face of the \$n\$-simplex and is contained in the class of simplicial, face-preserving near-homeomorphisms. Under the {PL}-Poincare conjecture, this characterizes the coinitial closure of selections.},

	abstract = {The commutative differential graded algebra \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{{PL}\}\}(X)\$ of polynomial forms on a simplicial set \$X\$ is a crucial tool in rational homotopy theory. In this note, we construct an integral version \$Aˆ\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}\}(X)\$ of \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{{PL}\}\}(X)\$. Our approach uses diagrams of chain complexes indexed by the category of finite sets and injections \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}\$ to model \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty\}\$ differential graded algebras by strictly commutative objects, called commutative \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}\$-dgas. We define a functor \$Aˆ\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}\}\$ from simplicial sets to commutative \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}\$-dgas and show that it is a commutative lift of the usual cochain algebra functor. In particular, it gives rise to a new construction of the \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty\}\$ dga of cochains. The functor \$Aˆ\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}\}\$ shares many properties of \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{{PL}\}\}\$, and can be viewed as a generalization of \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{{PL}\}\}\$ that works over arbitrary commutative ground rings. Working over the integers, a theorem by Mandell implies that \$Aˆ\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}\}(X)\$ determines the homotopy type of \$X\$ when \$X\$ is a nilpotent space of finite type.},

When K is a flag complex, we extend well-known results on Artin and Coxeter groups by confirming that the relevant circulation group is homotopy equivalent to the space of loops Ω {DJ}(K). We define homotopy colimits for diagrams of topological monoids and topological groups, and show they commute with the formation of classifying spaces in a suitably generalised sense. We deduce that the homotopy colimit of the appropriate diagram of topological groups is a model for Ω {DJ}(K) for an arbitrary complex K,and that the natural projection onto the original colimit is a homotopy equivalence when K is flag. In this case, the two models are compatible.},

While this is a vital perspective, the focus of this survey is squarely on the local homology of abstract simplicial complexes. Our motivation comes from the needs of the analysis of hypergraphs and graphs. In addition to presenting many classical facts in a unified way, this survey presents a few new results about how local homology generalizes useful tools from graph theory. The survey ends with a statistical comparison of graph invariants with local homology.},

	abstract = {Let X be a pathwise connected topological space and let X1 and X2 be two closed pathwise connected homeomorphic subspaces. An elementary proof is given that, provided X1 and X2 have disjoint open neighbourhoods and one of the spaces X1 and X2 is a strong deformation retract of its neighbourhood, the relation between the fundamental group of X and the space obtained by identifying X1 and X2 is the same as that discovered by van Kampen for less general conditions as a generalisation of an earlier theorem of Seifert. The relation also holds for nonclosed X1 and X2, if X is covered by the interior points of the complement of X1 ∪ X2 and the neighbourhoods of these spaces. Two counter-examples for this relation showing that local conditions are required are also presented in this paper. Also, this paper contains a discussion of additional properties for a neighbourhood deformation retract X1 that ensure that “collapsing a handle defined as trivial I-bundle” will induce a (weak) homotopy equivalence and it discusses relevant counter-examples.},

	abstract = {In telescopic homotopy theory, a space or spectrum X is approximated by a tower of localizations Ln {fX}, n≥ 0, taking account of vn-periodic homotopy groups for progressively higher n. For each n≥ 1, we construct a telescopic Kuhn functor Φ n carrying a space to a spectrum with the same vn-periodic homotopy groups, and we construct a new functor Θ n left adjoint to Φ n. Using these functors, we show that the nth stable monocular homotopy category (comprising the nth fibers of stable telescopic towers) embeds as a retract of the nth unstable monocular homotopy category in two ways: one giving infinite loop spaces and the other giving "infinite Ln f-suspension spaces." We deduce that Ravenel's stable telescope conjectures are equivalent to unstable telescope conjectures. In particular, we show that the failure of Ravenel's nth stable telescope conjecture implies the existence of highly connected infinite loop spaces with trivial Johnson-Wilson E(n)*-homology but nontrivial vn-periodic homotopy groups, showing a fundamental difference between the unstable chromatic and telescopic theories. As a stable chromatic application, we show that each spectrum is K(n)-equivalent to a suspension spectrum. As an unstable chromatic application, we determine the E(n)*-localizations and K(n)*-localizations of infinite loop spaces in terms of E(n)*-localizations of spectra under suitable conditions. We also determine the E(n)*-localizations and K(n)*-localizations of arbitrary Postnikov H-spaces.},

	abstract = {The notion of exterior space consists of a topological space together with a certain nonempty family of open subsets that is thought of as a ‘system of open neighbourhoods at infinity’ while an exterior map is a continuous map which is ‘continuous at infinity’. The category of spaces and proper maps is a subcategory of the category of exterior spaces. In this paper we show that the category of exterior spaces has a family of closed simplicial model structures, in the sense of Quillen, depending on a pair \{T,T′\} of suitable exterior spaces. For this goal, for a given exterior space T, we construct the exterior T-homotopy groups of an exterior space under T. Using different spaces T we have as particular cases the main proper homotopy groups: the Brown–Grossman, Čerin–Steenrod, p-cylindrical, Baues–Quintero and Farrell–Taylor–Wagoner groups, as well as the standard (Hurewicz) homotopy groups. The existence of this model structure in the category of exterior spaces has interesting applications. For instance, using different pairs \{T,T′\}, it is possible to study the standard homotopy type, the homotopy type at infinity and the global proper homotopy type.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06801},
	abstract = {The aim of these notes is to introduce the intuition motivating the notion of a "complicial set", a simplicial set with certain marked "thin" simplices that witness a composition relation between the simplices on their boundary. By varying the marking conventions, complicial sets can be used to model \$({\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty,n)\$-categories for each \$n {\textbackslash}textbackslashgeq 0\$, including \$n={\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty\$. For this reason, complicial sets present a fertile setting for thinking about weak infinite dimensional categories in varying dimensions. This overture is presented in three acts: the first introducing simplicial models of higher categories; the second defining the Street nerve, which embeds strict \${\textbackslash}textbackslashomega\$-categories as "strict" complicial sets; and the third exploring an important saturation condition on the marked simplices in a complicial set and presenting a variety of model structures that capture their basic homotopy theory. Scattered throughout are suggested exercises for the reader who wants to engage more deeply with these notions.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this book is to introduce algebraic topology using the novel approach of homotopy theory, an approach with clear applications in algebraic geometry as understood by Lawson and Voevodsky. This method allows the authors to cover the material more efficiently than the more common method using homological algebra. The basic concepts of homotopy theory, such as fibrations and cofibrations, are used to construct singular homology and cohomology, as well as K-theory. Throughout the text many other fundamental concepts are introduced, including the construction of the characteristic classes of vector bundles. Although functors appear constantly throughout the text, no knowledge about category theory is expected from the reader. This book is intended for advanced undergraduates and graduate students with a basic knowledge of point set topology as well as group theory and can be used in a two semester course.Marcelo Aguilar and Carlos Prieto are Professors at the Instituto de Matemticas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, and Samuel Gitler is a member of El Colegio Nacional and professor at the Centro de Investigación y Estudios Avanzados del {IPN}.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5762},
	abstract = {Grothendieck develops the theory of pro-objects over a category \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf\{C\}\$. The fundamental property of the category \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf\{Pro\}({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf\{C\})\$ is that there is an embedding \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf\{C\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashoverset\{c\}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashlongrightarrow\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf\{Pro\}({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf\{C\})\$, the category \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf\{Pro\}({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf\{C\})\$ is closed under small cofiltered limits, and these limits are free in the sense that for any category \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf\{E\}\$ closed under small cofiltered limits, pre-composition with \$c\$ determines an equivalence of categories \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{C\}at({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf\{Pro\}({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf\{C\}),{\textbackslash}textbackslash,{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf\{E\})\_+ {\textbackslash}textbackslashsimeq {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{C\}at({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf\{C\},{\textbackslash}textbackslash, {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathsf\{E\})\$, (where the "\$+\$" indicates the full subcategory of the functors preserving cofiltered limits). In this paper we develop a 2-dimensional theory of pro-objects. Given a 2-category \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{C\}\$, we define the 2-category \$2{\textbackslash}textbackslashhbox\{-\}{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{P\}ro({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{C\})\$ whose objects we call 2-pro-objects. We prove that \$2{\textbackslash}textbackslashhbox\{-\}{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{P\}ro({\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{C\})\$ has all the expected basic properties adequately relativized to the 2-categorical setting, including the universal property corresponding to the one described above. We have at hand the results of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{C\}at\$-enriched category theory, but our theory goes beyond the \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{C\}at\$-enriched case since we consider the non strict notion of pseudo-limit, which is usually that of practical interest.},

This generalizes results known for finite groups and poly-\$\$\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}\}\$\$Zgroups. The model actions are shown to be determined, up to strong cocycle conjugacy, by natural abstract properties, which are verified for some examples of actions arising from tensorial shifts. We also show the following homotopy rigidity result, which may be understood as a precursor to a general Kirchberg–Phillips-type classification theory: If two outer actions of an amenable group on a unital Kirchberg algebra are equivariantly homotopy equivalent, then they are conjugate. This marks the first C*-dynamical classification result up to cocycle conjugacy that is applicable to actions of all amenable groups.},

We investigate linear algebraic properties of the columns condition, especially for oriented (vertex-arc) incidence matrices of directed graphs and for sign pattern matrices. It is established that the oriented incidence matrix of a directed graph Γ has the columns condition if and only if Γ is strongly connected, and in this case an algorithm is presented to find a partition of the columns of the oriented incidence matrix with the maximum number of cells. It is shown that a sign pattern matrix allows the columns condition if and only if each row is either all zeros or the row has both a + and −.},

The Finite Sums theorem provided the first example of an infinite partition regular system of equations. Since then, other such systems of equations have been found, but each can be viewed as a modification of the Finite Sums theorem. We present here a new infinite partition regular system of equations that appears to arise in a genuinely different way. This is the first example of a partition regular system in which a variable occurs with unbounded coefficients. A modification of the system provides an example of a system that is partition regular over Q but not N, settling another open problem.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9807071},
	shorttitle = {Ideals in Triangulated Categories},
	abstract = {We begin by showing that in a triangulated category, specifying a projective class is equivalent to specifying an ideal I of morphisms with certain properties, and that if I has these properties, then so does each of its powers. We show how a projective class leads to an Adams spectral sequence and give some results on the convergence and collapsing of this spectral sequence. We use this to study various ideals. In the stable homotopy category we examine phantom maps, skeletal phantom maps, superphantom maps, and ghosts. (A ghost is a map which induces the zero map of homotopy groups.) We show that ghosts lead to a stable analogue of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a space, and we calculate this stable analogue for low-dimensional real projective spaces. We also give a relation between ghosts and the Hopf and Kervaire invariant problems. In the case of A-infinity modules over an A-infinity ring spectrum, the ghost spectral sequence is a universal coefficient spectral sequence. From the phantom projective class we derive a generalized Milnor sequence for filtered diagrams of finite spectra, and from this it follows that the group of phantom maps from X to Y can always be described as a limˆ1 group. The last two sections focus on algebraic examples. In the derived category of an abelian category we study the ideal of maps inducing the zero map of homology groups and find a natural setting for a result of Kelly on the vanishing of composites of such maps. We also explain how pure exact sequences relate to phantom maps in the derived category of a ring and give an example showing that phantoms can compose non-trivially.},

Thus, \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}\$ is an abelian category containing \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{A\}\$ as a full subcategory such that the inclusion functor \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{A\}{\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}\$ is exact and finitely continuous. Furthermore, \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}\$ is uniquely characterized up to equivalence by the following universal property: for every abelian category \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{B\}\$, a functor \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{A\}{\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}mathcal\{B\}\$ is exact and finitely continuous if and only if it extends to an exact (and necessarily finitely continuous) functor \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}{\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}mathcal\{B\}\$. We provide similar descriptions of the left heart of the following categories: non-Archimedean abelian Polish groups; (non-Archimedean) Polish \$G\$-modules, for a given Polish group or Polish ring \$G\$; Fr{\textbackslash}'\{e\}chet spaces over \$K\$ for a given separable complete non-Archimedean valued field \$K\$.},

	abstract = {These lecture notes, prepared for the summer school "Topological quantum groups", Bedlewo 2015, deal with aspects of the theory of actions of compact quantum groups on C*-algebras ('locally compact quantum spaces'). After going over the basic notions of isotypical components and reduced and universal completions, we look at crossed and smash product C*-algebras, up to the statement of the Takesaki-Takai-Baaj-Skandalis duality (in the algebraic setting). We then look at two special types of actions, namely homogeneous actions and free actions. We study the actions which combine both types, the quantum torsors, and show that more generally any homogeneous action can be completed to a free action with a discrete, classical set of `quantum orbits'. We end with a combinatorial description of the homogeneous actions for the free orthogonal quantum groups.},

	title = {Bounded cohomology of discrete groups},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08339},
	abstract = {Bounded cohomology of groups was first defined by Johnson and Trauber during the seventies in the context of Banach algebras. As an independent and very active research field, however, bounded cohomology started to develop in 1982, thanks to the pioneering paper "Volume and Bounded Cohomology" by M. Gromov, where the definition of bounded cohomology was extended to deal also with topological spaces. The aim of this monograph is to provide an introduction to bounded cohomology of discrete groups and of topological spaces. We also describe some applications of the theory to related active research fields (that have been chosen according to the taste and the knowledge of the author). The book is essentially self-contained. Even if a few statements do not appear elsewhere and some proofs are slighlty different from the ones already available in the literature, the monograph does not contain original results. In the first part of the book we settle the fundamental definitions of the theory, and we prove some (by now classical) results on low-dimensional bounded cohomology and on bounded cohomology of topological spaces. Then we describe how bounded cohomology has proved useful in the study of the simplicial volume of manifolds, for the classification of circle actions, for the definition and the description of maximal representations of surface groups, and in the study of higher rank flat vector bundles (also in relation with the Chern conjecture).},

We first identify a fundamental class of totally disconnected locally compact Polish groups: the elementary groups. We go on to prove a variety of local-to-global structure results. In particular, we show the useful and interesting p-adic Lie groups admit decompositions into simple groups and elementary groups via group extension. Our investigations next consider the structure of the collection periodic elements. Here a number of strong partial results are demonstrated. We conclude by studying the structure of totally disconnected locally compact Polish groups with topological conditions on conjugacy classes. Here we answer a question of A. Kechris and C. Rosendal.},

	abstract = {Let G be a totally disconnected locally compact topological group and let x be an element of G. Then a subgroup K is said to be tidy for x if K is a compact open subgroup of G which obeys certain algebraic and topological conditions. Willis showed that for every element x in a totally disconnected group G there exists at least one tidy subgroup. Associated with these tidy subgroups is a continuous scale function, mapping G into the positive integers. In this dissertation, several important examples of totally disconnected groups are analyzed, including {GL}(n, L) and {SL}(n, L), where L is a finite field extension of the p-adic numbers. An example is given in which the scale function maps G onto all of the positive integers. Several theorems are proved relating the scale function of G to that of its subgroups and quotient groups. A theorem is proved concerning the scale functions of semi-direct products of abelian groups, it is then generalized to a larger category of groups.},

We demonstrate a generalization of the Arveson Extension Theorem in this context. We also show that quotients of self-adjoint operator spaces can be endowed with a compatible operator space structure and characterize the kernels of completely positive completely bounded maps on self-adjoint operator spaces.},

This leads to the analysis of general linear operators on \${\textbackslash}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty/c\_0\$. We present many examples, introduce and investigate several classes of operators, for some of them we obtain satisfactory representations and for other give examples showing that it is impossible. In particular, we show that there are automorphisms of \${\textbackslash}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty/c\_0\$ which cannot be lifted to operators on \${\textbackslash}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty\$ and assuming {OCA}+{MA} we show that every automorphism of \${\textbackslash}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty/c\_0\$ with no fountains or with no funnels is locally, i.e., for some infinite \$A, B{\textbackslash}subseteq N\$ as above, induced by a bijection from \$B\$ to \$A\$. This additional set-theoretic assumption is necessary as we show that the continuum hypothesis implies the existence of counterexamples of diverse flavours. However, many basic problems, some of which are listed in the last section, remain open.},

We then apply this dual equivalence to establish a number of results about operator systems, some of which are new even in the unital setting. For example, we show that the maximal and minimal C*-covers of an operator system can be realized in terms of the C*-algebra of continuous nc functions on its nc quasistate space, clarifying recent results of Connes and van Suijlekom. We also characterize "C*-simple" operator systems, i.e. operator systems with simple minimal C*-cover, in terms of their nc quasistate spaces. We develop a theory of quotients of operator systems that extends the theory of quotients of unital operator algebras. In addition, we extend results of the first author and Shamovich relating to nc Choquet simplices. We show that an operator system is a C*-algebra if and only if its nc quasistate space is an nc Bauer simplex with zero as an extreme point, and we show that a second countable locally compact group has Kazhdan's property (T) if and only if for every action of the group on a C*-algebra, the set of invariant quasistates is the quasistate space of a C*-algebra.},

For these so-called tolerance relations, passing to the associated equivalence relation looses crucial information as is clear from the examples such as coarse graining in physics or the relation \$d(x,y){\textless} {\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ on a metric space. Fortunately, thanks to the formalism of operator systems such an extension is possible and provides new invariants, such as the \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-envelope and the propagation number. After a thorough investigation of the structure of the (non-unital) operator systems associated to tolerance relations, we analyze the corresponding state spaces. In particular, we determine the pure state space associated to the operator system for the relation \$d(x,y){\textless} {\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ on a path metric measure space.},

We obtain an axiomatic characterization of our l{\textasciicircum}1-homology as a universal delta-functor and prove that it is pre-dual to our definition of bounded cohomology.

	abstract = {Taking the l{\textasciicircum}1-completion and the topological dual of the singular chain complex gives rise to l{\textasciicircum}1-homology and bounded cohomology respectively. In contrast to l{\textasciicircum}1-homology, major structural properties of bounded cohomology are well understood by the work of Gromov and Ivanov. Based on an observation by Matsumoto and Morita, we derive a mechanism linking isomorphisms on the level of homology of Banach chain complexes to isomorphisms on the level of cohomology of the dual Banach cochain complexes and vice versa. Therefore, certain results on bounded cohomology can be transferred to l{\textasciicircum}1-homology. For example, we obtain a new proof of the fact that l{\textasciicircum}1-homology depends only on the fundamental group and that l{\textasciicircum}1-homology with twisted coefficients admits a description in terms of projective resolutions. The latter one in particular fills a gap in Park's approach. In the second part, we demonstrate how l{\textasciicircum}1-homology can be used to get a better understanding of simplicial volume of non-compact manifolds.},

	abstract = {The study of operator algebras on Hilbert spaces, and C∗-algebras in particular, is one of the most active areas within Functional Analysis. A natural generalization of these is to replace Hilbert spaces (which are L2-spaces) with Lp-spaces, for p∈[1,∞). The study of such algebras of operators is notoriously more challenging, due to the very complicated geometry of Lp-spaces by comparison with Hilbert spaces. We give a modern overview of a research area whose beginnings can be traced back to the 50’s, and that has seen renewed attention in the last decade through the infusion of new techniques. The combination of these new ideas with old tools was the key to answer some long standing questions. Among others, we provide a description of all unital contractive homomorphisms between algebras of p-pseudofunctions of groups.},

	abstract = {In this dissertation we prove that the derived enrichment of the homotopy category of differential graded categories (dg-categories) with respect to a certain model category structure defined by G. Tabuada, is computed by the dg-category of A-infinity functors. This result was originally formulated by M. Kontsevich but rio formal proof was available in the literature. We further put this construction into the framework of higher categories. We introduce a functor, called the simplicial nerve of an A-infinity category, defined on the category of (small) A-infinity categories and taking values in simplicial sets. This construction extends the nerve construction for dg-categories of J. Lurie. We prove that the nerve of any A-infinity category is an (∞,1)-category and that the nerve of a pretriangulated dg-category in the sense of A. Bondal and M. Kapranov is a stable (∞, 1)-category in the sense of J. Lurie. We then provide a series of applications of these results. We introduce an enhancement of the categories {dgCat} and A∞ Cat, of dg and A-infinity categories, to (∞, 2)-categories. We show that the (∞, 1)-category associated to the (∞, 2)-category of dg-categories is a model for the simplicial localization at the class of weak-equivalences of the Tabuada's model structure. Finally, we prove that the homotopy groups of the self-mapping space of the identity functor in the (∞, 2)-category of A-infinity categories compute the Hochschild cohomology for A-infinity categories.},

	abstract = {A \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebra satisfies the Universal Coefficient Theorem ({UCT}) of Rosenberg and Schochet if it is equivalent in Kasparov's \${KK}\$-theory to a commutative \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebra. This paper is motivated by the problem of establishing the range of validity of the {UCT}, and in particular, whether the {UCT} holds for all nuclear \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebras. We introduce the idea of a \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebra that "decomposes" over a class \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$ of \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebras. Roughly, this means that locally, there are approximately central elements that approximately cut the \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebra into two \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-subalgebras from \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$ that have well-behaved intersection. We show that if a \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebra decomposes over the class of nuclear, {UCT} \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebras, then it satisfies the {UCT}. The argument is based on controlled \${KK}\$-theory, as introduced by the authors in earlier work. Nuclearity is used via Kasparov's Hilbert module version of Voiculescu's theorem, and Haagerup's theorem that nuclear \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebras are amenable We say that a \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebra has finite complexity if it is in the smallest class of \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebras containing the finite-dimensional \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebras, and closed under decomposability; our main result implies that all \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebras in this class satisfy the {UCT}. The class of \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebras with finite complexity is large, and comes with an ordinal-number invariant measuring the complexity level. We conjecture that a \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebra of finite nuclear dimension and real rank zero has finite complexity; this (and several other related conjectures) would imply the {UCT} for all separable nuclear \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebras. We also give new local formulations of the {UCT}, and some other necessary and sufficient conditions for the {UCT} to hold for all nuclear \$C{\textasciicircum}*\$-algebras.},

When M is an o-minimal expansion of the reals (so H is a definable Lie group) this is related to Milnor's conjecture [15], and many cases are known. We also prove a strong relative Lω1, ω-categoricity theorem for universal covers of definable Lie groups, and point out some notable differences with the case of covers of complex algebraic groups (studied by Zilber and his students).},

Such K admits a representation as (A ℤ xkx)/ℤky where y = Nx + a for some k x k matrix N over Z and α ∈ Ak satisfying certain conditions of relative primeness and ℤk = \{(α1,..., αk) : αi, ∈ ℤ\}. The concept of absolute width of an f.e.e. K of A is defined and it is shown to be strictly smaller than the rank of A. A kind of basis substitution with respect to Smith diagonal matrices is shown to hold for homogeneous completely decomposable groups. This result together with general properties of our representations are used to provide a self contained proof that acd groups with two critical types are direct sum of groups of rank one and two.},

	abstract = {Let 
G(n){\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{\{{\textbackslash}rm G\}\}\}(n)
 be equal to either 
{PO}(n,1),{PU}(n,1){\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{\{{\textbackslash}rm {PO}\}\}\}(n,1),{\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{\{{\textbackslash}rm {PU}\}\}\}(n,1)
 or 
{PSp}(n,1){\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}textrm \{{PSp}\}\}\}(n,1)
 and let 
Γ≤G(n){\textbackslash}Gamma {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{\{{\textbackslash}rm G\}\}\}(n)
 be a uniform lattice. Denote by 
{HnK}{\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{H\}{\textasciicircum}n\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\}\}\}
 the hyperbolic space associated to 
G(n){\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{\{{\textbackslash}rm G\}\}\}(n)
, where 
K{\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\}\}
 is a division algebra over the reals of dimension d. Assume 
d(n−1)≥2d(n-1) {\textbackslash}geq 2
.In this article we generalise natural maps to measurable cocycles. Given a standard Borel probability 
Γ{\textbackslash}Gamma 
-space 
(X,μX)(X,{\textbackslash}mu \_X)
, we assume that a measurable cocycle 
σ:Γ×X→G(m){\textbackslash}sigma :{\textbackslash}Gamma {\textbackslash}times X {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{\{{\textbackslash}rm G\}\}\}(m)
 admits an essentially unique boundary map 
ϕ:∂∞{HnK}×X→∂∞{HmK}{\textbackslash}phi :{\textbackslash}partial \_{\textbackslash}infty {\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{H\}{\textasciicircum}n\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\}\}\} {\textbackslash}times X {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}partial \_{\textbackslash}infty {\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{H\}{\textasciicircum}m\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\}\}\}
 whose slices 
ϕx:{HnK}→{HmK}{\textbackslash}phi \_x:{\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{H\}{\textasciicircum}n\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\}\}\} {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{H\}{\textasciicircum}m\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\}\}\}
 are atomless for almost every 
x∈Xx {\textbackslash}in X
. Then there exists a 
σ{\textbackslash}sigma 
-equivariant measurable map 
F:{HnK}×X→{HmKF}: {\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{H\}{\textasciicircum}n\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\}\}\} {\textbackslash}times X {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{H\}{\textasciicircum}m\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\}\}\}
 whose slices 
Fx:{HnK}→{HmKF}\_x:{\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{H\}{\textasciicircum}n\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\}\}\} {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{H\}{\textasciicircum}m\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\}\}\}
 are differentiable for almost every 
x∈Xx {\textbackslash}in X
 and such that 
{JacaFx}≤1{\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}textrm \{Jac\}\}\}\_a F\_x {\textbackslash}leq 1
 for every 
a∈{HnKa} {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{H\}{\textasciicircum}n\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\}\}\}
 and almost every 
x∈Xx {\textbackslash}in X
. This allows us to define the natural volume 
{NV}(σ){\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}textrm \{{NV}\}\}\}({\textbackslash}sigma )
 of the cocycle 
σ{\textbackslash}sigma 
. This number satisfies the inequality 
{NV}(σ)≤Vol(Γ∖{HnK}){\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}textrm \{{NV}\}\}\}({\textbackslash}sigma ) {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}textrm \{Vol\}\}\}({\textbackslash}Gamma {\textbackslash}backslash {\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{H\}{\textasciicircum}n\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\}\}\})
. Additionally, the equality holds if and only if 
σ{\textbackslash}sigma 
 is cohomologous to the cocycle induced by the standard lattice embedding 
i:Γ→G(n)≤G(m)i:{\textbackslash}Gamma {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{\{{\textbackslash}rm G\}\}\}(n) {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{\{{\textbackslash}rm G\}\}\}(m)
, modulo possibly a compact subgroup of 
G(m){\textbackslash}operatorname \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{\{{\textbackslash}rm G\}\}\}(m)
 when 
m{\textgreater}nm{\textgreater}n
.Given a continuous map 
f:M→Nf:M {\textbackslash}rightarrow N
 between compact hyperbolic manifolds, we also obtain an adaptation of the mapping degree theorem to this context.},

	abstract = {A topological group is called a pro-Lie group if it is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of a product of finite-dimensional real Lie groups. This class of groups is closed under the formation of arbitrary products and closed subgroups and forms a complete category. It includes each finite-dimensional Lie group, each locally-compact group that has a compact quotient group modulo its identity component and, thus, in particular, each compact and each connected locally-compact group; it also includes all locally-compact Abelian groups. This paper provides an overview of the structure theory and the Lie theory of pro-Lie groups, including results more recent than those in the authors’ reference book on pro-Lie groups. Significantly, it also includes a review of the recent insight that weakly-complete unital algebras provide a natural habitat for both pro-Lie algebras and pro-Lie groups, indeed for the exponential function that links the two. (A topological vector space is weakly complete if it is isomorphic to a power {RX} of an arbitrary set of copies of R. This class of real vector spaces is at the basis of the Lie theory of pro-Lie groups.) The article also lists 12 open questions connected to pro-Lie groups.},

	abstract = {This is the second installment in a series of papers applying descriptive set theoretic techniques to both analyze and enrich classical functors from homological algebra and algebraic topology. In it, we show that the {\textbackslash}v\{C\}ech cohomology functors \${\textbackslash}check\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}\}{\textasciicircum}n\$ on the category of locally compact separable metric spaces each factor into (i) what we term their definable version, a functor \${\textbackslash}check\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}\}{\textasciicircum}n\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{def\}\}\$ taking values in the category \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{{GPC}\}\$ of groups with a Polish cover (a category first introduced in this work's predecessor), followed by (ii) a forgetful functor from \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{{GPC}\}\$ to the category of groups. These definable cohomology functors powerfully refine their classical counterparts: we show that they are complete invariants, for example, of the homotopy types of mapping telescopes of \$d\$-spheres or \$d\$-tori for any \$d{\textbackslash}geq 1\$, and, in contrast, that there exist uncountable families of pairwise homotopy inequivalent mapping telescopes of either sort on which the classical cohomology functors are constant. We then apply the functors \${\textbackslash}check\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}\}{\textasciicircum}n\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{def\}\}\$ to provide strong solutions to higher-dimensional and equivariant generalizations of a seminal problem in the development of algebraic topology, namely Borsuk and Eilenberg's 1936 problem of classifying, up to homotopy, the maps from a solenoid complement \$S{\textasciicircum}3{\textbackslash}backslash{\textbackslash}Sigma\$ to the \$2\$-sphere. In the course of this work, we record Borel definable versions of a number of classical results bearing on both the combinatorial and homotopical formulations of {\textbackslash}v\{C\}ech cohomology; in aggregate, this work may be regarded as laying foundations for the descriptive set theoretic study of the homotopy relation on the space of maps from a locally compact Polish space to a polyhedron, a relation which embodies a substantial variety of classification problems arising throughout mathematics.},

In particular, the orbit equivalence relations of such groupoids are up to Borel bireducibility precisely those of Polish group actions, answering a question of Lupini. Analogously, every non-Archimedean (i.e., every unit morphism has a neighborhood basis of open subgroupoids) open quasi-Polish groupoid is Borel equivalent to the groupoid of models on \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$ of an \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\}\_\{{\textbackslash}omega\_1{\textbackslash}omega\}\$-sentence in discrete logic. The proof in fact gives a topological representation of \$G\$ as the groupoid of isomorphisms between a "continuously varying" family of structures over the space of objects of \$G\$, constructed via a topological Yoneda-like lemma of Moerdijk for localic groupoids and its metric analog. Other ingredients in our proof include the Lopez-Escobar theorem for continuous logic, a uniformization result for full Borel functors between open quasi-Polish groupoids, a uniform Borel version of Kat{\textbackslash}v\{e\}tov's construction of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{U\}\$, groupoid versions of the Pettis and Birkhoff--Kakutani theorems, and a development of the theory of non-Hausdorff topometric spaces and their quotients.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2011.00437},
	abstract = {We systematically develop analogs of basic concepts from classical descriptive set theory in the context of pointless topology. Our starting point is to take the elements of the free complete Boolean algebra generated by the frame \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(X)\$ of opens to be the "\${\textbackslash}infty\$-Borel sets" in a locale \$X\$. We show that several known results in locale theory may be interpreted in this framework as direct analogs of classical descriptive set-theoretic facts, including e.g., the Lusin separation, Lusin-Suslin, and Baire category theorems for locales; we also prove several extensions of these results. We give a detailed analysis of various notions of image, and prove that a continuous map need not have an \${\textbackslash}infty\$-Borel image. We introduce the category of "analytic \${\textbackslash}infty\$-Borel locales" as the regular completion under images of the unary site of locales and \${\textbackslash}infty\$-Borel maps, and prove analogs of several classical results about analytic sets, such as a boundedness theorem for well-founded analytic relations. We also consider the "positive \${\textbackslash}infty\$-Borel sets" of a locale, formed from opens without using \${\textbackslash}neg\$. We in fact work throughout with \${\textbackslash}kappa\$-copresented \${\textbackslash}kappa\$-locales and \${\textbackslash}kappa\$-Borel sets for arbitrary regular \${\textbackslash}omega\_1 {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}kappa {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}infty\$, thereby incorporating the classical context as the special case \${\textbackslash}kappa = {\textbackslash}omega\_1\$. The basis for the aforementioned localic results is a detailed study of various known and new methods for presenting \${\textbackslash}kappa\$-frames, \${\textbackslash}kappa\$-Boolean algebras, etc. In particular, we introduce a new type of "two-sided posite" for presenting \$({\textbackslash}kappa, {\textbackslash}kappa)\$-frames \$A\$ (i.e., both \$A\$ and \$A{\textasciicircum}\{op\}\$ are \${\textbackslash}kappa\$-frames), and use this to prove a general \${\textbackslash}kappa\$-ary interpolation theorem for \$({\textbackslash}kappa, {\textbackslash}kappa)\$-frames, which dualizes to the aforementioned separation theorems.},

	abstract = {We study totally disconnected, locally compact (t.d.l.c.) groups from an algorithmic perspective. We give various approaches to defining computable presentations of t.d.l.c.{\textbackslash} groups, and show their equivalence. In the process, we obtain an algorithmic Stone-type duality between t.d.l.c.{\textasciitilde}groups and certain countable ordered groupoids given by the compact open cosets. We exploit the flexibility given by these different approaches to show that several natural groups, such as \${\textbackslash}Aut(T\_d)\$ and \${\textbackslash}{SL}\_n({\textbackslash}{QQ}\_p)\$, have computable presentations. We show that many construction leading from t.d.l.c.{\textbackslash} groups to new t.d.l.c.{\textbackslash} groups have algorithmic versions that stay within the class of computably presented t.d.l.c.{\textbackslash} groups. This leads to further examples, such as \${\textbackslash}{PGL}\_n({\textbackslash}{QQ}\_p)\$. We study whether objects associated with computably t.d.l.c.{\textbackslash} groups are computable: the modular function, the scale function, and Cayley-Abels graphs in the compactly generated case. We give a criterion when computable presentations of t.d.l.c.{\textasciitilde}groups are unique up to computable isomorphism, and apply it to \${\textbackslash}{QQ}\_p\$ as an additive group, and the semidirect product \${\textbackslash}{ZZ}{\textbackslash}ltimes {\textbackslash}{QQ}\_p\$.},

	abstract = {We extend the Becker--Kechris topological realization and change-of-topology theorems for Polish group actions in several directions. For Polish group actions, we prove a single result that implies the original Becker--Kechris theorems, as well as Sami's and Hjorth's sharpenings adapted levelwise to the Borel hierarchy; automatic continuity of Borel actions via homeomorphisms; and the equivalence of "potentially open" versus "orbitwise open" Borel sets. We also characterize "potentially open" \$n\$-ary relations, thus yielding a topological realization theorem for invariant Borel first-order structures. We then generalize to groupoid actions, and prove a result subsuming Lupini's Becker--Kechris-type theorems for open Polish groupoids, newly adapted to the Borel hierarchy, as well as topological realizations of actions on fiberwise topological bundles and bundles of first-order structures. Our proof method is new even in the classical case of Polish groups, and is based entirely on formal algebraic properties of category quantifiers; in particular, we make no use of either metrizability or the strong Choquet game. Consequently, our proofs work equally well in the non-Hausdorff context, for open quasi-Polish groupoids, and more generally in the point-free context, for open localic groupoids.},

In particular, the orbit equivalence relations of such groupoids are up to Borel bireducibility precisely those of Polish group actions, answering a question of Lupini. Analogously, every non-Archimedean (i.e., every unit morphism has a neighborhood basis of open subgroupoids) open quasi-Polish groupoid is Borel equivalent to the groupoid of models on \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$ of an \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\}\_\{{\textbackslash}omega\_1{\textbackslash}omega\}\$-sentence in discrete logic. The proof in fact gives a topological representation of \$G\$ as the groupoid of isomorphisms between a "continuously varying" family of structures over the space of objects of \$G\$, constructed via a topological Yoneda-like lemma of Moerdijk for localic groupoids and its metric analog. Other ingredients in our proof include the Lopez-Escobar theorem for continuous logic, a uniformization result for full Borel functors between open quasi-Polish groupoids, a uniform Borel version of Kat{\textbackslash}v\{e\}tov's construction of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{U\}\$, groupoid versions of the Pettis and Birkhoff--Kakutani theorems, and a development of the theory of non-Hausdorff topometric spaces and their quotients.},

Contrary to the absolute case, the standard t-structure on holonomic D-modules is not preserved by duality and hence the solution functor is no longer t-exact with respect to the canonical, resp. middle-perverse, t-structure. We provide an explicit description of these dual t-structures. We use this description to prove that the solution functor as well as the relative Riemann–Hilbert functor are t-exact with respect to the dual t-structure and to the middle-perverse one while the de Rham functor is t-exact for the canonical, resp. middle-perverse, t-structure and their duals.},

Such an action is treated as a metric structure that consists of the measure algebra of the probability measure space expanded by a family of its automorphisms. We prove that the existentially closed pmp actions of a given free group form an elementary class, and therefore the theory of pmp \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}\_k\$-actions has a model companion. We show this model companion is stable and has quantifier elimination. We also prove that the action of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}\_k\$ on its profinite completion with the Haar measure is metrically generic and therefore, as we show, it is existentially closed. We deduce our main result from a more general theorem, which gives a set of sufficient conditions for the existence of a model companion for the theory of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}\_k\$-actions on a separably categorical, stable metric structure.},

	abstract = {In recent years, much work has been done to measure and compare the complexity of orbit equivalence relations, especially for certain classes of Polish groups. We start by introducing some language to organize this previous work, namely the notion of classification strength of Polish groups. Broadly speaking, a Polish group \$G\$ has stronger classification strength than \$H\$ if every orbit equivalence relation induced by a continuous action of \$H\$ on a Polish space can be "emulated" by such an action of \$G\$ in the sense of Borel reduction. Among the non-Archimedean Polish groups, the groups with the highest classification strength are those that involve \$S\_{\textbackslash}infty\$, the Polish group of permutations of a countably-infinite set. We prove that several properties, including a weakening of the disjoint amalgamation in Fra{\textbackslash}"\{i\}ss{\textbackslash}'\{e\} theory, a weakening of the existence of an absolute set of generating indiscernibles, and not having ordinal rank for a particular coanalytic rank function, are all equivalent to a non-Archimedean Polish group involving \$S\_{\textbackslash}infty\$. Furthermore, we show the equivalence relation \$={\textasciicircum}+\$, which is a relatively simple benchmark equivalence relation in the theory of Borel reducibility, can only be classified by such groups that involve \$S\_{\textbackslash}infty\$.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05609},
	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2203.05609},
	abstract = {By an approximate subring of a ring we mean an additively symmetric subset \$X\$ such that \$X{\textbackslash}cdot X {\textbackslash}cup (X +X)\$ is covered by finitely many additive translates of \$X\$. We prove that each approximate subring \$X\$ of a ring has a locally compact model, i.e. a ring homomorphism \$f {\textbackslash}colon {\textbackslash}langle X {\textbackslash}rangle {\textbackslash}to S\$ for some locally compact ring \$S\$ such that \$f[X]\$ is relatively compact in \$S\$ and there is a neighborhood \$U\$ of \$0\$ in \$S\$ with \$f{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}[U] {\textbackslash}subseteq 4X + X {\textbackslash}cdot 4X\$ (where \$4X:=X+X+X+X\$). This \$S\$ is obtained as the quotient of the ring \${\textbackslash}langle X {\textbackslash}rangle\$ interpreted in a sufficiently saturated model by its type-definable ring connected component. The above theorem can be seen as a general structural result about approximate subrings: every approximate subring \$X\$ can be recovered up to additive commensurability as the preimage by a locally compact model \$f {\textbackslash}colon {\textbackslash}langle X {\textbackslash}rangle {\textbackslash}to S\$ of any relatively compact neighborhood of \$0\$ in \$S\$. It also leads to more precise structural or even classification results. For example, we deduce that every [definable] approximate subring \$X\$ of a ring of positive characteristic is additively commensurable with a [definable] subring contained in \$4X + X {\textbackslash}cdot 4X\$. This implies that for any given \$K,L {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$ there exists \$C(K,L)\$ such that every \$K\$-approximate subring \$X\$ (i.e. \$K\$ additive translates of \$X\$ cover \$X {\textbackslash}cdot X {\textbackslash}cup (X+X)\$) of a ring of positive characteristic \${\textbackslash}leq L\$ is additively \$C(K,L)\$-commensurable with a subring contained in \$4X + X {\textbackslash}cdot 4X\$. We also deduce a classification of finite approximate subrings of rings without zero divisors: for every \$K {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$ there exists \$N(K) {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$ such that for every finite \$K\$-approximate subring \$X\$ of a ring without zero divisors either \${\textbar}X{\textbar} {\textless}N(K)\$ or \$4X + X {\textbackslash}cdot 4X\$ is a subring which is additively \$K{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$-commensurable with \$X\$.},
